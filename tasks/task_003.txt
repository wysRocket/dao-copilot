# Task ID: 3
# Title: Core Meeting Platform Integrations (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet using their official APIs and OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Implement functionality to detect active meetings and capture audio streams securely.
# Details:
Backend: Develop service modules for each platform (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet). Use official SDKs/APIs. Implement OAuth 2.0 token management for each service. Frontend: UI for connecting/disconnecting integrations. Logic to select active meeting and initiate audio capture. For audio capture, investigate platform-specific methods (e.g., Zoom SDK, system audio capture for desktop app). Ensure clear user consent for audio access.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for connecting to each platform, listing meetings, and initiating audio stream capture. Test token refresh mechanisms. Verify UI indicators for active integrations.
