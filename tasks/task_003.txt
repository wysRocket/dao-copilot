# Task ID: 3
# Title: Core Meeting Platform Integrations (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet using their official APIs and OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Implement functionality to detect active meetings and capture audio streams securely using Electron's desktopCapturer with audio loopback.
# Details:
Backend: Develop service modules for each platform (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet) for meeting detection and authentication. Use official SDKs/APIs for meeting info and OAuth 2.0 token management. Deploy on Google Cloud Run or Compute Engine. Frontend: Implement system audio capture using Electron's desktopCapturer with audio loopback capability (following the pattern from https://github.com/beekmarks/electron-audio-capture-with-stt). UI for connecting/disconnecting integrations, selecting active meeting, and initiating system audio capture. Ensure clear user consent for audio access and display capture status.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for connecting to each platform, listing meetings, and initiating audio stream capture using desktopCapturer. Test token refresh mechanisms. Verify UI indicators for active integrations and audio capture status.
