# Task ID: 9
# Title: Basic Communication Analytics (Practice Mode - Local Processing)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement basic communication analytics (speaking pace, filler words, talk-time distribution) in a private 'practice mode'. Audio analysis should be performed locally on the client-side for privacy using the same audio capture pipeline as the transcription system.
# Details:
Frontend (Electron): Utilize the same audio capture pipeline from https://github.com/beekmarks/electron-audio-capture-with-stt - use Electron's desktopCapturer with audio loopback and AudioWorklet for real-time audio processing. Implement client-side JavaScript libraries for audio analysis (e.g., for pitch, energy to detect speech; custom logic for filler words based on local STT snippets if available, or simpler heuristics). Display analytics feedback to the user in real-time or post-session. No audio data should leave the user's device for this feature. Leverage the existing AudioWorklet implementation for real-time processing and analytics.

# Test Strategy:
Test accuracy of analytics (speaking pace, filler word detection, talk-time) against known samples. Verify that no audio data is transmitted for this feature. Usability testing for clarity and usefulness of feedback. Test integration with existing audio capture pipeline.
