# Task ID: 9
# Title: Basic Communication Analytics (Practice Mode - Local Processing)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement basic communication analytics (speaking pace, filler words, talk-time distribution) in a private 'practice mode'. Audio analysis should be performed locally on the client-side for privacy.
# Details:
Frontend (Tauri): Utilize Tauri's native audio capabilities for local audio capture in practice mode. Implement audio analysis using Rust plugins for Tauri for better performance (e.g., for pitch, energy to detect speech; custom logic for filler words based on STT snippets if available locally, or simpler heuristics). Display analytics feedback to the user in React in real-time or post-session. No audio data should leave the user's device for this feature. Optionally, allow users to save anonymized analytics to Cloud SQL for personal progress tracking.

# Test Strategy:
Test accuracy of analytics (speaking pace, filler word detection, talk-time) against known samples. Verify that no audio data is transmitted for this feature. Usability testing for clarity and usefulness of feedback.
