# Task ID: 5
# Title: User Document Upload & Secure Storage (Knowledge Base Foundation)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functionality for users to upload documents (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT) to create a personal/team knowledge base. Securely store these documents in S3. Define Document and KnowledgeBase data models and implement basic permission management.
# Details:
Backend: Create API endpoints in Axum for document upload (`/documents/upload`), listing, and deletion. Use multipart form handling in Axum for file uploads. Store metadata in PostgreSQL using sqlx (Document model: `id`, `userId`, `fileName`, `s3Key`, `uploadDate`, `knowledgeBaseId`). Store files in S3 with aws-sdk-rust with appropriate access controls (private by default). Frontend: UI for uploading, viewing, and managing documents within a knowledge base concept using React and Tauri's file system access.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for file upload handling and S3 interaction in Rust. Integration tests for the complete upload flow. Security testing for access control on S3 objects and API endpoints. Test various file types and sizes.
