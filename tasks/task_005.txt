# Task ID: 5
# Title: User Document Upload & Secure Storage (Knowledge Base Foundation)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functionality for users to upload documents (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT) to create a personal/team knowledge base. Securely store these documents in Google Cloud Storage. Define Document and KnowledgeBase data models and implement basic permission management.
# Details:
Backend: Create API endpoints for document upload (`/documents/upload`), listing, and deletion. Use `multer` or similar for handling file uploads. Store metadata in Cloud SQL PostgreSQL (Document model: `id`, `userId`, `fileName`, `gcsKey`, `uploadDate`, `knowledgeBaseId`). Store files in Google Cloud Storage with appropriate access controls (private by default). Use @google-cloud/storage SDK. Frontend: UI for uploading, viewing, and managing documents within a knowledge base concept.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for file upload handling and Google Cloud Storage interaction. Integration tests for the complete upload flow. Security testing for access control on Cloud Storage objects and API endpoints. Test various file types and sizes.
