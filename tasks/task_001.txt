# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize frontend (Electron with React/TypeScript) and backend (Node.js/Express) projects. Set up Docker for containerization, PostgreSQL for structured data, Google Cloud Storage for file storage, and establish Google Cloud Platform as the cloud provider. Establish basic CI/CD pipeline.
# Details:
Frontend: `npx create-electron-app meeting-copilot --template=typescript-webpack`, integrate React. Backend: `npm init -y`, install Express, pg, @google-cloud/storage. Docker: Create Dockerfiles for frontend and backend. Database: Define initial schemas for User, Meeting, Transcript, Note, Document, KnowledgeBase. Google Cloud: Set up basic IAM roles, Cloud Storage bucket, Cloud SQL instance for PostgreSQL. CI/CD: Basic Google Cloud Build or GitHub Actions pipeline for build and test.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for basic server setup. Verify successful build and containerization of both frontend and backend. Confirm database connectivity to Cloud SQL.
