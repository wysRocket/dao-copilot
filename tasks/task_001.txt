# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize frontend (Electron with React/TypeScript) and backend (Node.js/Express) projects. Set up Docker for containerization, PostgreSQL for structured data, S3 for file storage, and select a cloud provider (e.g., AWS). Establish basic CI/CD pipeline.
# Details:
Frontend: `npx create-electron-app meeting-copilot --template=typescript-webpack`, integrate React. Backend: `npm init -y`, install Express, pg, aws-sdk. Docker: Create Dockerfiles for frontend and backend. Database: Define initial schemas for User, Meeting, Transcript, Note, Document, KnowledgeBase. Cloud: Set up basic IAM roles, S3 bucket, RDS instance for PostgreSQL. CI/CD: Basic GitHub Actions or Jenkins pipeline for build and test.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for basic server setup. Verify successful build and containerization of both frontend and backend. Confirm database connectivity.
