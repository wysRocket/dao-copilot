# Task ID: 7
# Title: Private Note-Taking Assistance with E2EE and Export
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement AI-assisted private note-taking functionality visible only to the individual user during calls. Notes should be end-to-end encrypted (E2EE). Provide functionality for easy export of notes (e.g., TXT, MD).
# Details:
Frontend: Develop a dedicated notes panel in the meeting interface. Implement client-side encryption/decryption using a robust library (e.g., libsodium.js or Web Crypto API) with user-derived keys. Backend: Store encrypted note blobs. API endpoints for saving/retrieving encrypted notes. Implement export functionality. AI assistance could be simple suggestions based on transcript keywords or context, initially. Define Note data model (encrypted content).

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for encryption/decryption logic. Test note creation, editing, saving, and retrieval. Verify E2EE by inspecting stored data. Test export functionality for various formats. Security audit of the E2EE implementation.
