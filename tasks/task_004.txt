# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a service to process audio streams from meetings in real-time. Integrate Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for transcription. Implement speaker diarization and attribution. Display transcription with clear visual indicators in the frontend.
# Details:
Backend: Create a transcription service in Rust that receives audio chunks. Use tokio-tungstenite for WebSocket communication with the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API and frontend. Leverage Google's speaker diarization capabilities. Store transcripts linked to meetings and users in Cloud SQL using sqlx. Frontend: Display real-time transcriptions in React, clearly attributing speakers. Implement visual cues for active transcription.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for audio chunk processing and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API interaction in Rust. Integration tests with live audio stream. Accuracy testing with diverse accents and noisy environments. Verify speaker attribution accuracy. Test visual indicators in UI.
