# Task ID: 4
# Title: Real-time Audio Transcription Service with Speaker Attribution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a service to process audio streams from meetings in real-time using the same transcription approach as https://github.com/beekmarks/electron-audio-capture-with-stt. Integrate Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API and implement speaker diarization. Display transcription with clear visual indicators in the frontend.
# Details:
Frontend: Implement the exact audio capture and transcription pipeline from https://github.com/beekmarks/electron-audio-capture-with-stt - use Electron's desktopCapturer for system audio capture, AudioWorklet for real-time audio processing, and WAV file generation. Backend: Create a transcription service that receives audio data from the frontend pipeline. Send processed audio chunks to Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API with speaker diarization enabled. Use WebSocket for real-time communication with frontend. Store transcripts linked to meetings and users in Cloud SQL. Frontend: Display real-time transcriptions with speaker attribution and visual cues for active transcription.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for audio chunk processing using AudioWorklet and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API interaction. Integration tests with live audio stream from desktopCapturer. Accuracy testing with diverse accents and noisy environments. Verify speaker attribution accuracy. Test visual indicators in UI.
