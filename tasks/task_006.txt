# Task ID: 6
# Title: Contextual Information Retrieval from User Documents (Semantic Search)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a service for contextual information retrieval. This includes ingesting uploaded documents (parsing text, generating embeddings using models like Sentence Transformers or OpenAI Embeddings), storing embeddings in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or pgvector extension for PostgreSQL), and providing an API for semantic search based on user queries during meetings. Retrieval must be explicit and only from user-authorized documents.
# Details:
Backend: Implement document processing pipeline (e.g., using Tika for parsing, Langchain for chunking/embedding). Set up and integrate a vector database. Create API endpoint (`/search/contextual`) that takes a user query and returns relevant snippets from their documents. Ensure search respects document permissions. Frontend: UI element for users to type queries during meetings and view search results.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for document parsing, embedding generation, and vector DB interaction. Integration tests for the end-to-end search flow. Relevance testing of search results. Performance testing for query latency.
