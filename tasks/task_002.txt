# Task ID: 2
# Title: User Authentication & Management with OAuth 2.0
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement user registration, login (email/password), session management using JWTs, and profile management. Integrate OAuth 2.0 for at least one meeting platform (e.g., Zoom) for user authentication and authorization.
# Details:
Backend: Implement REST APIs for `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/refresh-token`, `/auth/oauth/zoom`. Use bcrypt for password hashing. Store user data in PostgreSQL. Frontend: Create registration, login, and profile pages. Handle JWT storage (securely, e.g., HttpOnly cookies or secure storage for Electron). Implement OAuth 2.0 client flow for Zoom.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for auth logic (registration, login, token generation/validation). Integration tests for OAuth flow with Zoom. Manual testing of user lifecycle: registration, login, logout, profile update.
