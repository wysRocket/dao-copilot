## 📋 Taskmaster Task 40

**Description:** Consolidate and optimize the transcription state management logic to improve maintainability, reduce state synchronization bugs, and provide a centralized state management solution.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create a unified state management solution for all transcription-related functionality
- Eliminate redundant state declarations across components
- Improve state synchronization between main and renderer processes
- Reduce complexity and potential race conditions in state updates

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Create Custom Hook
Create a custom hook `useTranscriptionState` to manage all transcription-related state:
- Implement using `useReducer` for complex state logic
- Define clear action types and reducer functions
- Include state for: transcription status, audio stream, recognition results, error states, and configuration

### Phase 2: State Management Architecture
- Use `useReducer` hook for complex state transitions
- Implement proper state synchronization between windows using Electron's IPC
- Consider using atomic state management library (Recoil or Jotai) if cross-window complexity increases
- Implement state persistence for user preferences

### Phase 3: IPC Integration
- Define clear IPC channels for transcription state updates
- Implement bidirectional state sync between main and renderer processes
- Add proper error handling and retry logic for IPC communications

### Phase 4: Migration
- Refactor existing components to use the new `useTranscriptionState` hook
- Remove legacy state management code
- Update all related components and utilities

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `useTranscriptionState` custom hook is created and fully typed
- [ ] All transcription state is managed through a single source of truth
- [ ] State synchronization works correctly between main and renderer processes
- [ ] No state-related race conditions or bugs in transcription flow
- [ ] All existing transcription features continue to work as expected
- [ ] State updates are performant with no unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Code coverage for state management logic is ≥ 80%
- [ ] Documentation is updated with new state management patterns

## 🔍 Technical Requirements

### State Structure
```typescript
interface TranscriptionState {
  status: 'idle' | 'initializing' | 'active' | 'paused' | 'error';
  isRecording: boolean;
  transcript: string;
  interimTranscript: string;
  error: Error | null;
  config: TranscriptionConfig;
  audioLevel: number;
}
```

### Components to Refactor
- Transcription controls
- Audio visualizer
- Transcript display
- Settings panel
- Stream overlay

### IPC Channels
- `transcription:state-update`
- `transcription:start`
- `transcription:stop`
- `transcription:pause`
- `transcription:resume`

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for `useTranscriptionState` hook
- [ ] Unit tests for reducer functions and action creators
- [ ] Integration tests for IPC state synchronization
- [ ] E2E tests for complete transcription flow
- [ ] Performance tests to ensure no unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Error handling tests for edge cases

## 📝 Notes

- Consider using Immer for immutable state updates if reducer logic becomes complex
- Ensure backward compatibility during migration
- Monitor bundle size impact if adding new state management library
- Document state flow diagrams for team reference
