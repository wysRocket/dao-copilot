* Accessibility: Design with accessibility standards in mind (e.g., WCAG compliance) to ensure the product can be used by people with diverse abilities.
* Trust-Inducing Aesthetics: The visual design should convey professionalism, security, and trustworthiness.
5.2. Key UX Flows
* Onboarding: Simple, guided setup process explaining permissions and core features, emphasizing ethical use and transparency.
* In-Meeting Assistance: Seamless activation of transcription and note-taking. Non-intrusive display of any user-solicited information.
* Post-Meeting Review: Easy access to transcripts, summaries, and action items.
* Knowledge Base Management: Intuitive interface for uploading, organizing, and searching documents.
* Settings & Preferences: Clear and comprehensive options for managing AI features, privacy settings, integrations, and account details.
6. Technical Considerations
6.1. High-Level Technical Architecture
* Client-Side Application: Desktop application (Electron with TypeScript/React for cross-platform MVP, or native Swift for macOS / C++/WinRT for Windows for optimal performance and deeper OS integration if resources allow). Responsible for secure audio/screen capture (with explicit user permission and clear indicators), local processing where feasible, and rendering the UI.
* Backend Infrastructure: Cloud-based (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) microservices architecture. Handles user authentication, secure data storage (encrypted user-uploaded documents, notes, preferences), AI model hosting/API calls, and integrations.
* AI Engine:
   * Speech-to-Text (STT): High-accuracy STT models.
   * Natural Language Processing (NLP) / Large Language Models (LLMs): For summarization, information retrieval, analytics. Decision required on using third-party LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google with strict data processing agreements ensuring no data retention for model training) versus fine-tuning/hosting open-source models in a private cloud environment. For MVP, prioritize models that allow for on-device or private cloud processing of user data to maximize privacy.
   * Data Processing: Strict separation of user data. AI models should ideally not be trained on customer-specific data unless explicitly opted-in for personalization features with clear consent.
* Database: Secure, encrypted databases for user accounts, metadata, and any user-generated content (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
* Integrations Layer: Robust API for seamless and secure integration with meeting platforms (Zoom, Teams, Meet) and other business tools (CRMs, etc.). OAuth 2.0 for authenticating third-party services.
6.2. Technology Stack (Proposed)
* Frontend (Desktop App): Electron with React/TypeScript (for MVP cross-platform) or Native (Swift/Objective-C for macOS, C++/WinRT or C# for Windows).
* Backend: Node.js with Express/NestJS, Python with Django/Flask, or Go. Microservices architecture.
* Cloud Platform: AWS, Azure, or GCP.
* AI/ML: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch. Utilize pre-trained models and APIs where appropriate, focusing on privacy-preserving options.
