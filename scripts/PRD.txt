# Overview
The Ethical AI Meeting Co-pilot is a SaaS platform designed to empower professionals to communicate more effectively and ethically in virtual meetings. Unlike competitors, it prioritizes transparency, user control, privacy, and skill development. The product provides real-time transcription, smart summarization, private note-taking, and contextual information retrieval, all with clear user consent and control. Target users include professionals, sales teams, and organizations seeking responsible AI solutions.

# Core Features

# Technical Architecture
- **System Components:**
  - Frontend: Electron app (React/TypeScript) for cross-platform desktop
  - Backend: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI microservices
  - AI/ML: Cloud APIs for STT and LLMs, with roadmap for on-device/private cloud models
  - Database: PostgreSQL for structured data, S3 for file storage, vector DB for semantic search
  - Integrations: OAuth 2.0 for Zoom, Teams, Google Meet
- **Data Models:**
  - User, Meeting, Transcript, Note, Document, KnowledgeBase, Analytics
- **APIs and Integrations:**
  - REST/GraphQL APIs for frontend-backend communication
  - Third-party APIs for meeting platforms and STT/LLM providers
- **Infrastructure Requirements:**
  - Containerized services (Docker/Kubernetes)
  - End-to-end encryption for all user data
  - Scalable cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure/GCP)

# Development Roadmap
- **MVP Requirements:**
  - Real-time transcription with speaker attribution and visual indicators
  - User document upload and secure storage
  - Semantic search and explicit info retrieval from user docs
  - Automated meeting summarization
  - Private, encrypted note-taking
  - Integrations with Zoom, Teams, Google Meet
  - Transparent operation and granular user controls
  - Basic communication analytics in practice mode
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Advanced analytics (sentiment, engagement)
  - Team-based collaboration (shared playbooks, collaborative notes)
  - Proactive meeting prep (suggested talking points)
  - Customizable AI personas/styles
  - Expanded integrations (CRMs, project management tools)
  - Action item tracking & reminders

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Foundation: User authentication, secure storage, and meeting platform integrations
- Core: Real-time transcription and visual indicators
- Add: Document upload, knowledge base, and semantic search
- Add: Meeting summarization and private note-taking
- Add: Communication analytics (practice mode)
- Finalize: Transparent controls, settings, and user management
- Each feature is atomic and can be improved iteratively after MVP

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Technical:**
  - Latency in real-time features: Use proven APIs, optimize streaming, phased rollout
  - Integration complexity: Start with one platform (e.g., Zoom), expand after validation
- **Privacy/Security:**
  - Data breaches: End-to-end encryption, regular audits, strict access controls
  - Compliance: Design for GDPR/CCPA from the start
- **MVP Scope:**
  - Overbuilding: Focus on core user journeys and P0 features only
  - Resource constraints: Prioritize features that deliver fastest user value
