      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down this infrastructure setup into discrete components: frontend initialization with Electron/React/TypeScript, backend setup with Node.js/Express, Docker containerization, PostgreSQL database setup with initial schemas, S3 storage configuration, and CI/CD pipeline establishment. Each component should be independently testable and deployable.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple technology stacks, infrastructure components, and foundational dependencies. Requires expertise in frontend, backend, DevOps, and cloud services. Critical foundation that affects all subsequent tasks."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Separate this authentication system into: basic user registration/login with email/password, JWT session management implementation, OAuth 2.0 integration with Zoom, secure token storage in Electron, and user profile management. Each authentication method should be independently functional and testable.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving security-critical components, OAuth 2.0 flows, JWT handling, and Electron-specific security considerations. Requires careful implementation to avoid vulnerabilities."

      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide this integration task by platform and functionality: Zoom API integration and OAuth, Microsoft Teams API integration, Google Meet API integration, Electron desktopCapturer audio implementation, meeting detection service, audio stream capture pipeline, and integration management UI. Each platform integration should be modular and independently testable.",
      "reasoning": "Very high complexity due to multiple third-party APIs, each with different authentication flows, rate limits, and capabilities. Audio capture adds technical complexity with system-level permissions and real-time processing requirements."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide this semantic search system into: document parsing and text extraction pipeline, embedding generation using ML models, vector database setup and integration, semantic search API with permission controls, and search UI with result presentation. Each component should be optimized for performance and accuracy.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity involving machine learning, vector databases, document processing, and search algorithms. Requires expertise in NLP, embeddings, and vector similarity search."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into security and functionality components: client-side encryption/decryption implementation, secure key management and derivation, note-taking UI with real-time editing, encrypted storage and retrieval APIs, and export functionality for multiple formats. Security audit should be conducted for each encryption component.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to end-to-end encryption requirements, key management, and security considerations. Requires cryptographic expertise and careful implementation to maintain security guarantees."
