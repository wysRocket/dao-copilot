# Gemini Live Model Name Correction - Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified

After implementing Task 22 (updating to `gemini-2.5-flash-live`), the application was failing with:

- "No Gemini Live models detected in API response"
- "liveModelsAvailable: 0, hasLiveAccess: false"
- Falling back to batch transcription instead of WebSocket Live API

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was a **model name error**. Through research, I discovered:

### ‚ùå Incorrect Model Name (used in Task 22):

- `gemini-2.5-flash-live` ‚Üê This model name **does not exist**

### ‚úÖ Correct Model Name:

- `gemini-live-2.5-flash` ‚Üê This is the **actual model name**

## API Research Findings

Based on Google Cloud documentation (July 2025):

### Available Gemini Live Models:

1. **`gemini-live-2.5-flash`**

   - Launch stage: **Private GA**
   - Release date: June 17, 2025
   - Requires special access approval

2. **`gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio`**
   - Preview model with enhanced audio features
   - 30 HD voices in 24 languages
   - Proactive and Affective Dialog features

### Access Requirements:

- **Private GA** status means the model requires special approval
- Not all API keys automatically have access
- May require requesting access through Google Cloud Console

## Immediate Fix Applied

### 1. Corrected Model Names in Core Files:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect):
export const GEMINI_LIVE_MODEL = 'gemini-2.5-flash-live'

// After (correct):
export const GEMINI_LIVE_MODEL = 'gemini-live-2.5-flash'
```

### 2. Updated Files:

- `/src/services/gemini-live-websocket.ts`
- `/src/services/main-stt-transcription.ts`
- `/src/services/audio-streaming-pipeline.ts`
- `/src/services/proxy-stt-transcription.ts`
- `/src/helpers/gemini-websocket-config.ts`
- `.env.example`

### 3. Modified Validation Logic:

- Changed validation to be less strict about Live model detection
- Added warning about "Private GA" access requirements
- Allow WebSocket connection attempt even if models aren't listed in API

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Fixed:

- Model name corrected to `gemini-live-2.5-flash`
- Validation logic updated to handle Private GA access
- No longer throwing errors during validation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Still Needs Resolution:

- API key may not have "Private GA" access to `gemini-live-2.5-flash`
- Need to either:
  1. Request access through Google Cloud Console
  2. Use alternative model if available
  3. Implement proper fallback strategy

## Next Steps (Task #23)

### Option A: Request Private GA Access

1. Contact Google Cloud Support
2. Request access to `gemini-live-2.5-flash` model
3. May require business justification

### Option B: Alternative Model

1. Check if `gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio` is accessible
2. Test with publicly available Gemini models
3. Implement model fallback hierarchy

### Option C: Enhanced Fallback Strategy

1. Implement graceful degradation
2. Automatic model detection and selection
3. Better user messaging about access limitations

## Environment Variable Updates

Update your `.env` file:

```bash
# Correct model name:
GEMINI_MODEL_NAME="gemini-live-2.5-flash"

# Alternative if access not available:
# GEMINI_MODEL_NAME="gemini-2.5-flash"  # Standard 2.5 Flash (non-live)
```

## Impact Assessment

### ‚úÖ Positive:

- Corrected model name aligns with Google documentation
- Better error handling and logging
- Application won't crash during validation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding:

- WebSocket Live API may still fail due to access restrictions
- User will see batch transcription instead of live streaming
- Need resolution for full Live API functionality
