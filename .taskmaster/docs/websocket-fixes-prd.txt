# WebSocket API Implementation Fixes - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

This project focuses on fixing critical WebSocket connection issues in the dao-copilot application's Gemini Live API integration. The current implementation has several problems with connection establishment, message handling, and error recovery that need to be addressed for proper real-time transcription functionality.

## Business Objectives

1. **Reliable Real-time Communication**: Ensure WebSocket connections to Gemini Live API are stable and performant
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error recovery mechanisms for various failure scenarios  
3. **Improved User Experience**: Provide seamless audio transcription with minimal connection interruptions
4. **Production Readiness**: Make the WebSocket implementation robust enough for production deployment

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Issues Identified:

1. **Connection Establishment Problems**:
   - WebSocket connection timeouts not properly handled
   - API key validation issues during connection setup
   - TLS/SSL configuration problems in certain environments

2. **Message Processing Issues**:
   - Stack overflow errors in message handling due to recursive event loops
   - Rate limiting not properly implemented for message emission
   - Missing circuit breaker patterns for preventing cascading failures

3. **Error Recovery Gaps**:
   - Inadequate reconnection strategies for network interruptions
   - Missing session resumption capabilities
   - Insufficient error classification and handling

4. **Performance Bottlenecks**:
   - Message queue overflow in high-traffic scenarios
   - Inefficient heartbeat monitoring implementations
   - Memory leaks in connection lifecycle management

   - Implement efficient heartbeat monitoring with minimal overhead
   - Add memory leak prevention and resource cleanup

### API Integration Requirements

1. **Gemini Live API Compatibility**:
   - Ensure full compliance with v1beta API specifications
   - Support for all response modalities (TEXT, AUDIO)
   - Proper handling of setup, turn completion, and streaming messages

2. **Audio Processing**:
   - Implement robust audio data streaming with chunking
   - Add audio format validation and conversion capabilities
   - Support for real-time audio transcription workflows

3. **Security & Authentication**:
   - Secure API key management and rotation
   - Implement proper SSL/TLS certificate validation
   - Add support for proxy configurations in restricted environments

### Quality & Monitoring

1. **Logging & Diagnostics**:
   - Comprehensive logging for all connection events and errors
   - Performance metrics collection and reporting
   - Debug capabilities for troubleshooting connection issues

2. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Unit tests for all WebSocket components
   - Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
   - Load testing for high-traffic conditions

3. **Documentation**:
   - API documentation for WebSocket client usage
   - Troubleshooting guides for common issues
   - Configuration examples and best practices

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals:
- [ ] WebSocket connections establish reliably within 5 seconds under normal conditions
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms handle 95% of common failure scenarios automatically
- [ ] Message processing supports sustained throughput of 100+ messages/second
- [ ] Zero memory leaks during extended operation periods
- [ ] Complete test coverage for all critical WebSocket functionality

### Secondary Goals:
- [ ] Support for multiple concurrent WebSocket connections
- [ ] Real-time performance monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Automated connection health checking and reporting
- [ ] Integration with existing application logging and monitoring systems

## Technical Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing transcription service interfaces
- Should work in both Electron main process and renderer process environments
- Must support Node.js v18+ and modern browser WebSocket implementations
- Should integrate with existing error handling and logging infrastructure
- Must respect API rate limits and quota restrictions from Google
