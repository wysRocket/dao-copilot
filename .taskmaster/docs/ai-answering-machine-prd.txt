# AI Answering Machine PRD - Voice Activity Detection & Tool Use Integration

## Project Overview
Implement a comprehensive AI-powered answering machine system that combines Voice Activity Detection (VAD) with Google Gemini Live API tool use capabilities. The system will intelligently detect questions in real-time transcription, automatically perform web searches using tool calls, and provide immediate answers to users.

## Core Features

### 1. Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Integration
- Implement Google Gemini Live API VAD for real-time interruption handling
- Configure VAD sensitivity thresholds for optimal question detection
- Handle audio interruptions gracefully during tool call execution
- Maintain conversation state during VAD transitions

### 2. Question Detection & Classification
- Real-time analysis of transcribed text for question patterns
- Natural language processing to identify interrogative sentences
- Context-aware question classification (factual, procedural, conversational)
- Support for multi-part and complex questions

### 3. Google Live API Tool Use Implementation
- Integrate Google Search tool with Gemini Live API
- Configure tool calling parameters and schemas
- Handle tool call execution during live conversations
- Implement fallback mechanisms for tool failures

### 4. Intelligent Search & Answer System
- Automatic Google Search execution for detected questions
- Search query optimization based on question context
- Result parsing and relevance scoring
- Answer synthesis from multiple search results

### 5. Real-time Answer Display
- Stream answers back to user interface immediately
- Support for partial answer updates during search
- Visual indicators for search and processing states
- Answer confidence scoring and source attribution

### 6. Conversation State Management
- Maintain context across multiple question-answer pairs
- Handle follow-up questions and clarifications
- Preserve conversation history for reference
- Session management with proper cleanup

## Technical Requirements

### Audio Processing
- Low-latency VAD implementation with < 100ms response time
- Support for various audio formats and sample rates
- Noise reduction and audio quality enhancement
- Real-time audio streaming integration

### API Integration
- Google Gemini Live API v2 with VAD support
- Google Search API integration via tool calls
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### User Interface
- Real-time transcription display with question highlighting
- Search progress indicators and loading states
- Answer display with source links and attribution
- Conversation history with expandable answers

### Performance
- Sub-second response time for question detection
- Optimized search query execution (< 2 seconds)
- Efficient memory usage for conversation state
- Scalable architecture for multiple concurrent sessions

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components
1. VADManager - Voice activity detection and interruption handling
2. QuestionDetector - Real-time question identification and classification
3. ToolCallHandler - Google Live API tool use coordination
4. SearchService - Google Search integration and result processing
5. AnswerSynthesizer - Answer generation and formatting
6. ConversationManager - State management and history tracking

### Data Flow
1. Audio input → VAD processing → interruption detection
2. Transcription → question detection → classification
3. Question → tool call → Google Search execution
4. Search results → answer synthesis → user display
5. Answer delivery → conversation state update

### Integration Points
- Existing transcription pipeline integration
- Current audio processing system enhancement
- UI component updates for answer display
- Database integration for conversation persistence

## Success Metrics
- Question detection accuracy > 95%
- Average response time < 3 seconds end-to-end
- Search relevance score > 85%
- User satisfaction with answer quality > 90%
- System uptime > 99.9%

## Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing React/TypeScript codebase
- Compatible with current Electron architecture
- Integrate with existing audio pipeline
- Maintain real-time performance requirements
- Support offline fallback modes

## Security & Privacy
- Secure API key management for Google services
- User data privacy protection for conversations
- Optional conversation history encryption
- Compliance with data retention policies

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for API interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete question-answer flow
- Performance testing under various load conditions
- User acceptance testing for answer quality
