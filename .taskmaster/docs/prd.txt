# Product Requirements Document: Gemini Live API WebSocket Integration

## Overview
Update the DAO Copilot transcribing flow to integrate with Google's Gemini Live API using WebSocket connections for real-time transcription capabilities. This migration from the current batch-based approach will provide better performance, lower latency, and improved accuracy.

## Background
The current implementation uses batch-based transcription where audio is recorded in intervals and sent to the Gemini API via HTTP requests. Google has released the Gemini Live API which provides enhanced real-time transcription features through WebSocket connections, offering better performance and lower latency.

## Objectives
- Replace the current batch-based transcription with real-time WebSocket streaming
- Implement WebSocket client for Gemini Live API integration
- Maintain all existing functionality while improving performance
- Provide seamless user experience with real-time transcription updates
- Implement robust error handling and reconnection logic

- Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Support binary and text message formats

### 2. Real-time Audio Streaming
- Replace batch audio processing with continuous streaming
- Implement audio capture using Web Audio API
- Convert audio data to required format (16-bit PCM)
- Stream audio chunks in real-time over WebSocket
- Implement audio buffering and backpressure handling

### 3. Connection Management
- Proper WebSocket connection lifecycle management
- Handle network interruptions gracefully
- Implement heartbeat mechanism for connection health
- Support authentication and session management
- Clean up resources on disconnection

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery
- Graceful handling of WebSocket connection failures
- Fallback to HTTP-based approach when WebSocket fails
- Network interruption recovery
- API error handling and user feedback
- Connection state management and status indicators

### 5. UI/UX Updates

- Connection status indicators
- Streaming progress feedback
- Smooth animations for live transcription
- Performance optimizations for continuous updates

### 6. Performance Optimization
- Efficient audio data processing
- Memory management for continuous streaming
- CPU usage optimization
- Network bandwidth optimization
- Responsive UI during streaming operations
