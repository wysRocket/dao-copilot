# Fix WebSocket Connection Issues and Implement Batch Transcription Improvements

## Project Overview

This project aims to fix critical WebSocket connection issues and implement batch transcription improvements for the dao-copilot application. The primary goal is to ensure consistent use of the 'gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview' model across all audio processing services and improve overall system reliability.

## Problem Statement

Based on analysis of PR #171, several critical issues have been identified:

1. **Model Inconsistency**: Different models are being used across services (gemini-2.0-flash-live-001 for WebSocket, gemini-1.5-flash for batch API) instead of the required gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview
2. **WebSocket Connection Problems**: Connection establishment issues with current model configuration, poor session management, and inadequate error handling
3. **Batch Transcription Issues**: Incorrect model configuration, suboptimal audio processing pipeline, and unreliable fallback mechanisms

## Target Users

- Developers using the dao-copilot application for audio transcription
- End users relying on real-time audio processing capabilities
- System administrators maintaining the audio processing infrastructure

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **WebSocket Configuration Updates**
   - All WebSocket configurations must use gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview model
   - Connection establishment must be reliable and consistent
   - Session management must handle reconnections gracefully
   - Error handling and recovery mechanisms must be robust

2. **Batch Transcription Improvements**
   - Batch API configuration must use gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview model
   - Audio processing pipeline must be optimized for performance
   - Fallback strategies must be implemented for failed operations
   - Model configuration consistency across all batch services

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Default model configurations must be updated across all services
   - Environment configuration must use correct model settings
   - Test configurations must match production model settings
   - API endpoint configurations must be verified and corrected

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Reliability**: System must maintain stable connections with improved error recovery
2. **Performance**: Audio processing pipeline must be optimized for low latency
3. **Consistency**: All services must use the same model configuration
4. **Maintainability**: Code must be well-structured with clear error handling

## Key Features

### WebSocket Fixes
- Update gemini-live-websocket.ts for proper model configuration
- Fix websocket-connection-establisher.ts connection logic
- Enhance audio-streaming-pipeline.ts model configuration
- Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Implement better session management

### Batch Transcription Improvements
- Update main-stt-transcription.ts model configuration
- Fix proxy-stt-transcription.ts model settings
- Optimize audio processing pipeline performance
- Implement robust fallback strategies

### Configuration Updates
- Update gemini-websocket-config.ts with correct model settings
- Ensure environment configuration consistency
- Update test configurations to match new model
- Verify and correct API endpoint configurations

## Technical Specifications

### Files to Modify

**Primary Service Files:**
- src/services/gemini-live-websocket.ts
- src/services/main-stt-transcription.ts
- src/services/proxy-stt-transcription.ts
- src/services/websocket-connection-establisher.ts
- src/services/audio-streaming-pipeline.ts

**Configuration Files:**
- src/helpers/gemini-websocket-config.ts
- .env.example
- Related test files

### Model Configuration
- Primary Model: gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview
- All services must use this model consistently
- No fallback to other models unless explicitly configured

## Success Criteria

1. All WebSocket connections successfully use gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview model
2. Batch transcription services consistently use gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview model
3. Improved connection reliability with robust error handling
4. Consistent model usage across all audio processing services
5. Better fallback mechanisms for failed connections
6. All tests pass with new model configuration

## Priority and Timeline

- **Priority**: High - Affects core functionality of audio transcription system
- **Impact**: Critical for proper operation with required model
- **Dependencies**: Must coordinate with existing PR #171
- **Target**: Complete implementation and testing within current development cycle

## Constraints and Assumptions

- Must maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Should not break existing functionality during transition
- Assumes gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview model is available and stable
- Must work within current authentication and API key infrastructure

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Model availability and API compatibility
- **Medium Risk**: Breaking changes during implementation
- **Low Risk**: Performance impact during transition
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing and gradual rollout strategy
