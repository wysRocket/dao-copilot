# Product Requirements Document: @rdev/liquid-glass-react Integration

## Project Overview
Integrate @rdev/liquid-glass-react library to enhance the DAO Copilot AI assistant interface with modern glassmorphism effects and Fumadocs dark theme aesthetics.

## Background
The current DAO Copilot application has a functional UI but needs visual enhancement to provide a more modern, professional desktop application aesthetic. The integration should maintain all existing functionality while applying glassmorphism effects and dark theme styling.

## Objectives
1. Recreate the AI assistant interface using glassmorphism design patterns
2. Apply Fumadocs dark theme (black/dark gray color scheme)
3. Enhance visual appeal without impacting performance
4. Maintain accessibility and keyboard navigation
5. Ensure seamless integration with existing multi-window Electron architecture

## Target Components for Refactoring

### Phase 1: Core Interface Components
- **TranscriptDisplay.tsx**: Chat/conversation display with liquid-glass overlays
- **PerformanceDashboard.tsx**: Feature summary component with glass accents
- **CustomTitleBar.tsx**: Dark glass title bar with Ask AI button and controls

### Phase 2: UI Component Mapping
- **CustomTitleBar.tsx** → Dark glass navigation bar
- **TranscriptDisplay.tsx** → Chat panel with glass effect
- **PerformanceDashboard.tsx** → Features/info block with glass styling
- **window-button.tsx, button.tsx** → Action buttons and toolbar
- **window-status.tsx** → Session/timer/status indicators
- **window-input.tsx** → AI chat input with glass effects

### Phase 3: Technical Implementation
- Install and configure @rdev/liquid-glass-react
- Set up dark theme color variables
- Apply glass overlays, blur, and opacity effects
- Ensure Fumadocs-style typography consistency

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- Test in Electron multi-window context
- Maintain IPC and window focus communication
- Optimize glass rendering performance
- Validate accessibility features

## Success Criteria
1. Interface functionality recreated with glassmorphism effects
2. Dark theme applied consistently across all components
3. Performance maintained or improved
4. All existing IPC communication preserved
5. Accessibility and keyboard navigation retained
6. Professional desktop application aesthetic achieved

## Technical Requirements
- Maintain existing React/TypeScript architecture
- Preserve Electron multi-window functionality
- Keep existing state management and IPC patterns
- Ensure compatibility with current build system (Vite)
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Glass effects should not impact rendering performance
- Accessibility: All UI elements remain keyboard navigable
- Compatibility: Works across all supported platforms
- Maintainability: Code remains clean and well-documented

## Out of Scope
- Changes to core application logic
- Modifications to transcription functionality
- Alterations to window management system
- Performance monitoring system changes
