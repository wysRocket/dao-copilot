# Live Transcription System Optimization & Cleanup PRD

## Project Overview
The live transcription system using Gemini Live WebSocket API is now functionally complete with proper text accumulation controlled by REC/STOP buttons. This PRD outlines optimization and cleanup tasks to improve code quality, performance, and maintainability.

## Current State Assessment
- ✅ Gemini Live WebSocket integration working
- ✅ Real-time transcription streaming implemented
- ✅ Text accumulation during recording sessions
- ✅ Manual transcription completion via REC/STOP button
- ✅ Dual state management (unified + context) functioning
- ✅ Garbage collection disabled to prevent transcript loss
- ✅ localStorage persistence for transcript history

## Optimization & Cleanup Goals

### 1. Code Architecture Cleanup
**Objective**: Simplify and consolidate the transcription state management system
- Remove redundant state management systems (currently using both unified TranscriptionStateManager and StreamingTextContext)
- Consolidate to single source of truth for transcription state
- Clean up unused imports and variables
- Standardize naming conventions across components

### 2. Performance Optimization
**Objective**: Improve real-time transcription performance and reduce memory usage
- Optimize WebSocket message handling and processing
- Implement efficient text accumulation algorithms
- Reduce React re-renders during streaming
- Optimize component update cycles
- Implement proper memoization where needed

### 3. Error Handling & Resilience
**Objective**: Make the system more robust and user-friendly
- Improve WebSocket connection error handling
- Add proper fallback mechanisms for quota exceeded scenarios
- Implement retry logic for failed connections
- Add user feedback for connection states and errors
- Handle edge cases in text accumulation logic

### 4. Code Quality & Maintainability
**Objective**: Improve code readability, testing, and documentation
- Remove debug console logs from production code
- Add proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Implement unit tests for core transcription logic
- Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Refactor large functions into smaller, testable units

### 5. User Experience Enhancements
**Objective**: Polish the transcription interface and interactions
- Improve visual feedback during recording states
- Add keyboard shortcuts for recording control
- Implement better loading states and progress indicators
- Enhance accessibility features
- Add configuration options for transcription behavior

### 6. Technical Debt Reduction
**Objective**: Address accumulated technical debt
- Remove commented-out code and unused files
- Update deprecated dependencies
- Standardize error handling patterns
- Implement consistent logging strategy
- Clean up file organization and imports

## Success Criteria
- Single, clean state management system for transcriptions
- Improved performance with faster real-time updates
- Robust error handling with graceful degradation
- Clean, well-documented codebase
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Enhanced user experience with better feedback

## Technical Constraints
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing transcription data
- Preserve localStorage persistence functionality
- Keep WebSocket integration functional
- Maintain current UI/UX patterns
- Ensure cross-platform Electron compatibility

## Priority Levels
1. **High**: Code architecture cleanup and state management consolidation
2. **High**: Performance optimization for real-time streaming
3. **Medium**: Error handling and resilience improvements
4. **Medium**: Code quality and maintainability
5. **Low**: User experience enhancements
6. **Low**: Technical debt reduction

## Implementation Phases
**Phase 1**: State management consolidation and architecture cleanup
**Phase 2**: Performance optimization and error handling
**Phase 3**: Code quality improvements and testing
**Phase 4**: User experience enhancements and final polish
