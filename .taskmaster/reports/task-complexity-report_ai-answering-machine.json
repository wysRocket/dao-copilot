		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Security and Privacy Measures",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of security and privacy measures into specific subtasks, including API key management, data encryption, secure session handling, and compliance with data protection regulations.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex cryptographic operations, secure key management, and integration with cloud services. It requires a deep understanding of security best practices and potential vulnerabilities. The high number of components and their interdependencies increase the overall complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Real-time Answer Display System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the real-time answer display system implementation into subtasks covering WebSocket setup, UI component development, state management, and performance optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Real-time systems require careful consideration of performance and state management. The WebSocket integration and the need for smooth updates increase complexity. However, the task is more straightforward than security implementations, hence the lower complexity score."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the VAD integration into subtasks covering API setup, audio processing, sensitivity configuration, and integration with the conversation flow.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating VAD requires working with low-level audio processing and real-time streaming, which are complex tasks. The need for fine-tuning sensitivity and handling various audio scenarios adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Question Detection and Classification System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the question detection and classification system into subtasks covering NLP model selection, question pattern analysis, classification algorithm development, and integration with the conversation pipeline.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves advanced NLP techniques and machine learning, which are inherently complex. The need for real-time analysis and accurate classification across various question types increases the difficulty."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Google Live API Tool Use",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Google Live API integration into subtasks covering API setup, query execution, result parsing, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "While API integration is a common task, the complexity here comes from handling real-time tool calls, managing rate limits, and ensuring seamless integration with the conversation flow. The need for error handling and fallback mechanisms adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Intelligent Search and Answer System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the intelligent search and answer system into subtasks covering query optimization, result ranking, answer synthesis, confidence scoring, and caching mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires advanced algorithms for query optimization and result ranking. The answer synthesis process involves complex NLP techniques. The need for high accuracy and performance in a real-time setting significantly increases the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Conversation State Management System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the conversation state management system into subtasks covering context tracking, follow-up question handling, persistence layer implementation, and session management.",
			"reasoning": "Managing conversation state across multiple turns is a complex task requiring sophisticated NLP techniques. The need for efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of conversation history, along with handling topic changes and follow-ups, contributes to the high complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Comprehensive Testing Suite and CI/CD Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the testing suite and CI/CD pipeline development into subtasks covering unit testing setup, integration testing, end-to-end testing, performance testing, security testing, and deployment automation.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive testing suite for a complex system with multiple integrations is challenging. The variety of test types, need for high coverage, and setup of a robust CI/CD pipeline contribute to the complexity. The interdependencies between components add to the difficulty of thorough testing."
