   b. Verify functionality across different browsers (if applicable)
   c. Test on different device types and screen sizes
   d. Validate performance on low-end devices
   e. Test with different network conditions

8. User Acceptance Testing:
   a. Create test scenarios based on real user workflows
   b. Develop a UAT test plan with specific acceptance criteria
   c. Document test cases for manual verification
   d. Prepare test data representing real-world usage
   e. Create a feedback collection mechanism for testers

9. Automated Test Suite Implementation:
   a. Implement Jest or Mocha test suite for unit and integration tests
   b. Create mock WebSocket server to simulate Gemini Live API responses
   c. Implement test fixtures and helpers for common test operations
   d. Set up CI/CD pipeline integration for automated test execution
   e. Configure test coverage reporting

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   a. Implement unit tests for all WebSocket client functions:
      - Connection establishment and authentication
      - Message formatting and parsing
      - Session management functions
      - Error handling and reconnection logic
   b. Use Jest or similar framework with mocking capabilities
   c. Aim for at least 80% code coverage
   d. Include positive and negative test cases

2. Integration Testing:
   a. Create a mock WebSocket server that simulates the Gemini Live API:
      - Implement standard response patterns
      - Simulate various error conditions
      - Support session management features
   b. Test the complete flow from connection to response handling
   c. Verify proper integration with audio streaming components
   d. Test with realistic data volumes and message patterns

3. Performance Testing:
   a. Use benchmarking tools to measure and compare:
      - Connection establishment time
      - Message round-trip time
      - Throughput under load
      - Resource utilization
   b. Create performance baselines for comparison
   c. Test under various network conditions (high latency, packet loss)
   d. Document performance characteristics and limitations

4. End-to-End Testing:
   a. Create automated E2E tests using Playwright or similar tools
   b. Test complete user workflows from UI to API and back
   c. Verify correct handling of real audio input
   d. Validate response rendering in the UI
   e. Test across multiple platforms and environments

5. Manual Testing:
   a. Create a detailed test plan for manual verification
   b. Include test cases for all acceptance criteria
   c. Document steps to reproduce and expected results
   d. Implement a structured approach to collecting and addressing feedback
   e. Conduct user acceptance testing with stakeholders

6. Test Reporting:
   a. Generate comprehensive test reports including:
      - Test coverage metrics
      - Pass/fail statistics
      - Performance benchmarks
      - Identified issues and resolutions
   b. Create dashboards for monitoring test results
   c. Implement automated notifications for test failures
   d. Document any limitations or known issues
