# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop Backpressure and Buffer Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement backpressure mechanisms and buffer management to handle high load and prevent buffer saturation.
# Details:
Create a BufferManager class that implements backpressure mechanisms to handle high burst input without losing data. Implement buffer saturation detection and mitigation strategies to prevent the oldest partials from not being finalized. Add adaptive buffer sizing based on available memory and current load. Implement prioritization for buffer processing to ensure critical operations (like finalization) take precedence during high load. Create a buffer health monitoring system to track buffer utilization and detect potential issues before they cause data loss.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test buffer operations under various load conditions. Test backpressure mechanisms with simulated high input rates. Create integration tests that push the system to buffer saturation and verify no data is lost. Benchmark buffer performance to ensure it meets throughput requirements. Test adaptive sizing to verify it correctly responds to changing conditions.
