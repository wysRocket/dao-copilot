# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a logging and monitoring system for tracking WebSocket connections, performance metrics, and error rates.
# Details:
1. Implement application-wide logging using winston (version 3.x).
2. Create custom log transports for different environments (development, production).
3. Implement log rotation and archiving for production logs.
4. Use Prometheus client library (prom-client version 14.x) for metrics collection.
5. Implement custom metrics for WebSocket connection status, latency, and error rates.
6. Create a dashboard using Grafana for visualizing metrics.
7. Implement distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry (version 1.x) for request flow tracking.
8. Use Sentry (version 7.x) for error tracking and crash reporting.
9. Implement log aggregation using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a cloud-based solution.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify logging output for various application scenarios.
2. Test log rotation and archiving functionality.
3. Validate metrics collection and accuracy.
4. Test integration with monitoring and alerting systems.
5. Perform end-to-end testing of the logging and monitoring pipeline.
