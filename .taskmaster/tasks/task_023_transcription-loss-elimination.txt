# Task ID: 23
# Title: Develop Testing Framework and Chaos Suite
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 16, 17, 18, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive testing framework including network simulation, crash injection, and chaos testing to verify transcription resilience.
# Details:
Implement a testing framework that:
1. Creates simulated network flaps (drop, jitter, latency injection)
2. Implements crash-injection during critical points: mid-partial, pre-final flush, WAL write
3. Develops an audio tail loss harness to verify captured transcription completeness
4. Integrates chaos suite into CI for nightly runs
5. Creates deterministic test scenarios for reproducible results
6. Implements verification tools to compare transcription against reference
7. Adds performance benchmarking capabilities

Code structure:
```typescript
class NetworkSimulator {
  simulateDrops(dropRate: number, duration: number): void {...}
  simulateLatency(minMs: number, maxMs: number, duration: number): void {...}
  simulateJitter(jitterMs: number, duration: number): void {...}
  restoreNormalConditions(): void {...}
}

class CrashInjector {
  injectCrashAtPoint(point: 'mid-partial' | 'pre-flush' | 'wal-write'): void {...}
  scheduleRandomCrash(probabilityPerSecond: number): void {...}
}

class AudioTailTester {
  private referenceAudio: AudioData;
  private referenceTranscript: string;
  
  constructor(referenceAudio: AudioData, referenceTranscript: string) {...}
  
  runTest(): Promise<{
    completeness: number;
    missingSegments: string[];
    passed: boolean;
  }> {...}
}

class ChaosSuite {
  private tests: Array<() => Promise<boolean>>;
  
  addTest(name: string, test: () => Promise<boolean>): void {...}
  runAll(): Promise<TestResults> {...}
  generateReport(): TestReport {...}
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify network simulation accurately reproduces real-world conditions
2. Test crash injection at various critical points
3. Validate audio tail loss harness against known reference transcripts
4. Verify chaos suite integration with CI
5. Test deterministic scenarios for reproducibility
6. Verify performance benchmarking accuracy
7. Test the test framework itself for reliability
8. Ensure minimal false positives/negatives in test results
