# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Feature Flag Rollout and Acceptance Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a controlled rollout process with acceptance testing to safely deploy the new transcription pipeline.
# Details:
Develop a RolloutManager class that implements progressive feature flag enabling based on user segments or other criteria. Create an acceptance test suite that verifies all success metrics are met: capture completeness >= 99.95%, partialâ†’final orphan rate < 0.05%, finalization latency < 1.5s (95th percentile), missed tail-on-stop < 100ms average, recovery success >= 99%, zero duplicate visual artifacts per 10k entries, and persistence durability losing < 1s of recent audio on crash. Implement a canary deployment process that monitors metrics for 48 hours before wider rollout. Create a rollback mechanism in case issues are detected during rollout.

# Test Strategy:
Test the feature flag rollout mechanism with various user segments. Verify the acceptance test suite correctly measures all required metrics. Create integration tests that simulate the canary deployment process. Test the rollback mechanism to ensure it correctly reverts to the previous system state. Verify metrics collection during the canary period is accurate and complete.
