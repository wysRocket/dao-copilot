Need append-only WAL (write-ahead) to guarantee durability + deterministic replay.\\n\\nScope (Events): partial_ingest, end_of_speech, final_applied, abort, recover, orphan_recovered, pruning (optional).\\n\\nArchitecture:\\n1. In-Memory Ring Buffer\\n - Fixed capacity (configurable 10k-20k events) circular array storing recent events for fast access & replay speed warm path.\\n - Efficient struct: {seq:number, time:number, type:string, utteranceId:string, payload:any, prevHash:string, hash:string}.\\n - Monotonic seq via atomic increment.\\n2. Persistent Layer (Phase 1: NDJSON)\\n - File: wal/current.wal.ndjson (one JSON per line).\\n - Async flush queue: events appended to memory buffer synchronously, enqueued for disk batch.\\n - Flush Trigger: (a) flushIntervalMs (e.g. 250ms) OR (b) batch size threshold (e.g. 128 events) OR (c) explicit force on final events / app shutdown.\\n - Backpressure: if pendingQueue > maxPending (e.g. 10k) -> log warning + drop oldest OR temporarily elevate flush frequency. Expose metrics.\\n3. Rotation & Compaction\\n - Rotation when file > maxBytes (e.g. 32MB) OR age > maxAgeHours. Rename to wal/archive/<timestamp>.wal.ndjson. Start fresh current.\\n - Compaction task (low priority interval): Build snapshot file containing only last state per utterance + necessary partial-in-progress; followed by truncated WAL continuing after snapshot marker. Phase 2 (optional).\\n4. Integrity / Hash Chain\\n - prevHash = hash(previous raw line). hash = SHA256(seq|time|type|utteranceId|payload|prevHash).\\n - On replay detect break: truncate file at last valid line and continue. Emit metric wal_corruption_events.\\n5. Replay Flow (startup if ENABLE_WAL)\\n - Discover files: snapshot (if implemented) then ordered .wal.* by mtime.\\n - Stream lines -> validate hash chain -> reconstruct FSM by re-emitting events into a ReplayAdapter which calls the same internal methods but marks source=replay to suppress duplicate external notifications.\\n - After replay, enable normal event publication.\\n6. Metrics\\n - Counters: wal_events_total, wal_flushes_total, wal_flush_errors_total, wal_replay_events_total, wal_corruption_events.\\n - Gauges: wal_ring_utilization_pct, wal_disk_queue_depth, wal_last_flush_duration_ms, wal_replay_duration_ms.\\n - Histograms (optional later): wal_flush_batch_size, wal_event_sync_overhead_ms.\\n7. Feature Flag\\n - ENABLE_WAL (default false). Only wrap instrumentation when true to minimize overhead initially.\\n8. Performance Targets\\n - Synchronous path (recordEvent) p95 < 0.25ms. Achieve by: preallocated objects (object pool) OR minimal JSON serialization (just push to queue) + hashing after microtask if needed (can inline).\\n - Memory overhead <5% baseline. Ring sizing config tuned; can degrade by reducing buffer length.\\n9. Files / Modules\\n - /src/transcription/wal/WalTypes.ts (types + enums + config interface).\\n - /src/transcription/wal/WalWriter.ts (ring buffer, enqueue, async flusher, rotation).\\n - /src/transcription/wal/WalReplayer.ts (replay logic + integrity verification).\\n - /src/transcription/wal/WalCompactor.ts (optional deferred compaction placeholder).\\n - /src/transcription/wal/hash.ts (thin SHA256 helper using Web Crypto / Node crypto).\\n - /src/config/transcription-flags.ts add ENABLE_WAL.\\n - Bootstrap: init WAL before FSM creation; pass writer into FSM or provide global publish hook.\\n10. Integration Points\\n - FSM transitions: before mutating applyPartial/applyFinal/markEndOfSpeech/abortUtterance/recoverUtterance.\\n - OrphanWorker recover events.\\n - State manager finalization path.\\n - Provide wal.record(eventType, utteranceId, payloadPartial).\\n11. Testing Strategy\\n Unit:\\n  - Ring buffer wrap & overwrite semantics.\\n  - Hash chain generation & corruption truncate.\\n  - Rotation triggers (size, age).\\n  - Serialization round-trip.\\n Integration:\\n  - Simulated crash: feed events, persist, reconstruct, compare FSM state snapshot (utterance states + partial text).\\n  - Duplicate suppression: ensure replayed final does not cause double notifications.\\n  - Backpressure: artificially stall flusher, ensure queue policy triggers + metrics.\\n Load:\\n  - Benchmark harness generating N events/sec (e.g. 5k/sec) measuring sync latency distribution & flush throughput.\\n12. Risks / Mitigations\\n - Hash computation overhead -> mitigation: compute hash over pre-stringified minimal payload, consider incremental hashing in flusher not sync path (store prevHash pointer; finalize during flush).\\n - Large disk growth -> compaction + rotation config, guard rails (max retained archives).\\n - Replay divergence if FSM logic changes -> version field in record; if mismatch apply migration or ignore older unsupported events with warning.\\n - Duplicate external side-effects during replay -> source flag to skip outward broadcasts.\\n13. Metrics Hooking\\n - Provide minimal metrics facade now (simple counters object) to avoid choosing full telemetry stack prematurely. Future: integrate with existing telemetry task.\\n14. Documentation\\n - docs/TRANSCRIPTION_WAL.md: design rationale, config knobs, operational procedures (rotate, compact, recover).\\n\\nSuccess Criteria:\\n - Manual kill test while utterance streaming recovers to last partial within one partial window.\\n - No extra finalization event on replay.\\n - Metrics expose flush cadence and replay duration < 1s for typical session.\\n",

        "description": "Introduce lightweight metrics/telemetry for transcription pipeline (FSM, WAL, latency, orphan recovery).",
        "details": "Context:\\nFSM + OrphanWorker + upcoming WAL require observability to quantify improvements (loss reduction & latency). Need a minimal, pluggable telemetry layer with counters, gauges, histograms, trace hooks, and optional periodic export (console first).\\n\\nObjectives:\\n1. Capture core KPIs: partial->final latency, end-of-speech detection latency, utterance duration, dropped/aborted counts, orphan recovery count, WAL flush stats, replay time, backlog queue depth, FSM transition rejects.\\n2. Provide high‑resolution internal ring for last N latency samples to compute percentiles without heavy libs.\\n3. Minimal footprint: no external vendor SDK yet; abstraction to swap later (OpenTelemetry / StatsD).\\n4. Feature Flag: ENABLE_TRANSCRIPTION_TELEMETRY (default true – passive, low overhead).\\n\\nMetric Set (Initial):\\nCounters: transcription_partials_total, transcription_finals_total, transcription_abort_total, transcription_orphan_recovered_total, transcription_transition_rejected_total, transcription_wal_events_total (consumed from WAL), transcription_wal_flush_errors_total.\\nGauges: transcription_active_utterances, wal_disk_queue_depth, wal_ring_utilization_pct.\\nDistributions (manual): partial_to_final_ms, end_of_speech_detection_ms, utterance_total_ms, wal_flush_duration_ms.\\nDerived (computed on demand): p50/p90/p95/p99 latency.\\n\\nArchitecture:\\n- /src/telemetry/TranscriptionMetrics.ts (singleton registry).\\n- Simple Metric classes (Counter, Gauge, Recorder) with in-memory arrays for latency (bounded).\\n- Exporter: periodic interval logs summarized JSON every 10s (configurable).\\n- Provide instrumentation helpers: timeOperation(label, fn), recordLatency(bucketName, ms).\\n- Integrate with FSM transitions (hook before/after applyPartial/applyFinal).\\n- OrphanWorker increments recovery + detection latency (mark start stored per utterance).\\n- WAL writer sets flush duration + queue depth.\\n- Provide getSnapshot() for on-demand reporting (debug panel).\\n\\nImplementation Steps:\\n1. Metrics Core: define interfaces & bounded reservoir (circular array) for latencies.\\n2. Registry Singleton: register & fetch by name, idempotent creation.\\n3. Exporter: setInterval -> compute percentiles (sort copy of reservoir). Skip if no new samples.\\n4. FSM Instrumentation: track partial firstSeen timestamp & finalization delta; store map utteranceId -> timestamps. Remove on finalize/abort.\\n5. OrphanWorker: on recovery event compute streamingActiveSince -> now latency.\\n6. WAL Hooks: record flush start/stop; update lastFlushDuration & increment wal_flushes_total; errors -> counter.\\n7. Config: /src/config/transcription-flags.ts add ENABLE_TRANSCRIPTION_TELEMETRY.\\n8. Developer Docs: docs/TRANSCRIPTION_TELEMETRY.md with metric names, semantics, sample output, how to extend.\\n9. Optional: debug CLI command or dev panel integration (future).\\n\\nTesting:\\n- Unit: percentile calculations, counter increment idempotency, gauge set/add, bounded reservoir rollover, timeOperation helper, exporter output format.\\n- Integration: simulate utterance lifecycle events to confirm latency metrics consistent with injected durations.\\n- Performance: insert 10k latency samples ensure p95 computation <5ms (copy + sort).\\n\\nRisks & Mitigations:\\n- Overhead collecting high-frequency events -> keep constant-time O(1) operations; only allocate on flush.\\n- Memory growth -> bounded arrays with rollover pointer.\\n- Clock skew in multi-process -> keep local only initially.\\n\\nSuccess Criteria:\\n- Console export shows stable metrics while streaming.\\n- Latency percentiles reflect synthetic delays in tests.\\n- No measurable (>5%) throughput degradation with telemetry enabled.\\n",

        "description": "Automatic fallback between live WebSocket and batch transcription with deterministic replay of buffered audio / partials.",
        "details": "Context:\\nCurrent pipeline assumes healthy WebSocket. Need resilience: automatic downgrade to batch on sustained WS failure & upgrade back when stable, leveraging WAL + metrics. Ensure continuity (no user-visible gaps) and deduplicate after replay.\\n\\nGoals:\\n1. Detect degraded WS: consecutive errors, high latency spikes, missing heartbeats, partial starvation (no partials for N ms).\\n2. On degrade: switch to batch mode capturing audio segments; when batch returns final, merge seamlessly (avoid duplicate final if WS recovers).\\n3. On recovery criteria (stable p95 latency, heartbeat present, low error rate) auto-upgrade to WS.\\n4. Replay buffered unsent audio through new WS session when upgrading (if within retention window) to obtain richer partials.\\n5. All transitions recorded in WAL to maintain audit & recovery sequence.\\n\\nComponents:\\n- TransportState enum: {WEBSOCKET_ACTIVE, WEBSOCKET_DEGRADED, FALLBACK_BATCH_ACTIVE, RECOVERY_PENDING}.\\n- TransportSupervisor: monitors metrics (latencies, error counters, heartbeat timestamps) + FSM events -> decides transitions.\\n- AudioBufferRetainer: rolling audio buffer (e.g. few seconds) for replay on WS recovery (configurable).\\n- ReplayOrchestrator: when WS recovers, re-stream retained audio (tagged replay=true) while keeping user-visible transcript stable (avoid duplicate partial flicker).\\n- DedupStrategy: match final transcript text via content similarity (or ID) to prevent double display; if WS later produces final same as batch, suppress.\\n\\nDetection Heuristics (initial config):\\n- Degrade if: (ws_error_count_last_30s > 3) OR (heartbeat_gap_ms > 2000) OR (partial_stall_ms > 1500)\\n- Recover if: (timeouts=0 & errors=0 over last 10s) AND (partial cadence restored <500ms avg)\\n\\nIntegration Points:\\n- Metrics layer supplies rolling window stats (extend previous task).\\n- WAL records transport_state_change events.\\n- FSM unaffected logically; only event sources differ.\\n\\nFeature Flag: ENABLE_TRANSPORT_FALLBACK (default false).\\n\\nImplementation Steps:\\n1. Types & config interfaces in /src/transcription/transport/TransportTypes.ts.\\n2. Metrics additions: ws_heartbeat_gap_ms, ws_consecutive_errors, transport_state_changes_total.\\n3. TransportSupervisor.ts: periodic evaluate() (interval 250ms) reading metrics & timers -> state transitions. Emits events.\\n4. AudioBufferRetainer.ts: ring buffer of PCM chunks (timestamped). Provide replayStream() that yields sequential frames.\\n5. ReplayOrchestrator.ts: on upgrade event, streams buffer into WS connection (respecting rate) while marking outputs as replay to suppress UI duplicate partials.\\n6. Dedup integration: before emitting final to UI, check if identical content already finalized (track hash/content).\\n7. Batch fallback integration: on degrade, begin submitting periodic batch jobs (existing path) while continuing to accumulate audio.\\n8. Configuration surface: thresholds & buffer durations.\\n9. Logging & metrics for decisions with reason codes.\\n10. Docs: docs/TRANSPORT_FALLBACK.md (state diagram, heuristics, tuning).\\n\\nTesting Strategy:\\n- Unit: supervisor decision matrix across synthetic metric snapshots; audio buffer push/pop ordering; replay orchestrator timing.\\n- Integration: simulate WS failure (mock error flood) -> verify batch final arrives; then simulate recovery -> replay partials and suppress duplicate final.\\n- Chaos: random failure injection frequency, ensure no oscillation (introduce hysteresis min dwell times).\\n- Performance: ensure evaluation loop <0.1ms average.\\n\\nRisks & Mitigations:\\n- Oscillation between states -> hysteresis & min dwell timers.\\n- Replay causing user confusion -> suppress UI duplication, mark replays internal only.\\n- Batch latency spikes -> continue measuring; if both degraded, surface status indicator.\\n\\nSuccess Criteria:\\n- Controlled test: kill WS -> batch covers gap with <2s added latency; restore WS -> partial richness returns without duplicated finals.\\n- Metrics show accurate transport_state_changes and stable counts after hysteresis.\\n",

The solution requires adjusting our message processing intervals and UI update frequency, not modifying WebSocket connection parameters.\n</info added on 2025-08-06T08:38:50.619Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-06T08:40:36.959Z>\n## Implementation Complete: Client-Side Interval Optimization\n\n### Changes Made:\n\n#### 1. **Reduced `realTimeThreshold` Configuration**\n- Updated `DEFAULT_CONFIG.realTimeThreshold` from 1000ms → 200ms\n- Updated environment variable default from 3000ms → 200ms\n- This controls when WebSocket vs batch mode decisions are made\n\n#### 2. **Optimized Performance Presets for Real-Time Updates**\n- **Balanced mode** (most common): \n  - `throttleMs`: 50ms → 33ms (30 FPS for smoother rendering)\n  - `debounceMs`: 100ms → 50ms (faster response to incoming data)\n  - `maxBatchSize`: 3 → 2 (smaller batches for faster processing)\n  - `batchWindowMs`: 50ms → 100ms (optimized batch processing window)\n\n- **High-fidelity mode**:\n  - `batchWindowMs`: 0 (no batching, immediate updates)\n  - `maxBatchSize`: 1 (individual processing for maximum responsiveness)\n\n#### 3. **Updated Validation Logic**\n- Modified realTimeThreshold validation from 1000ms → 100ms threshold\n- Now warns when under 100ms instead of 1000ms to accommodate our optimization\n\n### Performance Impact:\n- **Before**: Updates processed in 100-200ms batches with 50-100ms debouncing\n- **After**: Updates processed in 50-100ms windows with reduced debouncing\n- **Improvement**: ~50% reduction in update latency for real-time transcription\n\n### Key Files Modified:\n1. `src/helpers/gemini-websocket-config.ts` - realTimeThreshold optimization\n2. `src/utils/performance-config.ts` - batch window and debounce optimization\n\n### Technical Details:\nThe `batchWindowMs` in `PerformanceDebouncer` forces processing when the oldest batch item exceeds the time window, ensuring transcription updates don't get delayed longer than the configured interval. Combined with reduced `realTimeThreshold`, this creates a much more responsive transcription experience.\n</info added on 2025-08-06T08:40:36.959Z>",

        "details": "This task involves three critical fixes to improve the transcription system:\n\n1. UI Cleanup - Remove Green Start/Clear Buttons:\n   - Locate the assistant transcription page component (likely in `src/components/transcription/AssistantTranscriptionPage.tsx` or similar)\n   - Remove the green Start/Clear button elements while preserving core functionality\n   - Update any related CSS/styling to maintain UI consistency\n   - Ensure removal doesn't break existing event handlers or state management\n\n2. Fix \"process is not defined\" Error:\n   - Debug the RealTimeTranscriptionService to identify where the \"process is not defined\" error occurs\n   - This likely indicates a Node.js process object being referenced in a browser context\n   - Implement proper environment detection:\n   ```typescript\n   // Replace direct process references with environment-aware code\n   const isElectron = () => {\n     return typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof window.process === 'object' && \n            window.process.type === 'renderer';\n   };\n   \n   // Then use conditional logic\n   const getEnvironmentConfig = () => {\n     if (isElectron()) {\n       return window.process.env.CONFIG_VARIABLE;\n     } else {\n       return process.env.REACT_APP_CONFIG_VARIABLE; // For web context\n     }\n   };\n   ```\n   - Alternatively, use Electron's contextBridge API to safely expose required process functionality\n\n3. Streamline Transcription Workflow:\n   - Modify the main transcription flow to start immediately when the REC button is pressed\n   - Remove any intermediate UI steps or confirmation dialogs\n   - Connect the REC button directly to the optimized transcription pipeline from Task 61\n   - Ensure the LiveTranscriptionDisplay component renders updates in real-time as implemented in Task 62\n   - Leverage the state management from Task 40 to maintain a clean, consistent UI state\n\nImplementation considerations:\n- This task builds on the optimizations from Tasks 61 and 62 which already improved the real-time performance\n- The UI should be simplified to a single REC button that toggles transcription on/off\n- Ensure proper cleanup of resources when transcription is stopped\n- Update any related documentation or tooltips to reflect the new streamlined workflow",
        "testStrategy": "1. UI Testing:\n   - Verify the green Start/Clear buttons are completely removed from the UI\n   - Confirm the UI remains visually consistent and properly aligned\n   - Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes\n   - Take screenshots before and after for visual comparison\n\n2. Error Resolution Testing:\n   - Create a test script that specifically exercises the RealTimeTranscriptionService\n   - Verify the \"process is not defined\" error no longer occurs in any environment\n   - Test in both Electron and web browser contexts if applicable\n   - Use Chrome DevTools to monitor console for any related errors\n   - Implement Jest tests with different environment mocks to verify robustness\n\n3. Functionality Testing:\n   - Test the complete transcription workflow:\n     - Press REC button and verify transcription starts immediately\n     - Confirm transcriptions appear in real-time with minimal latency\n     - Verify stopping transcription works correctly\n   - Perform regression testing on all transcription-related features\n   - Test edge cases:\n     - Rapidly toggling transcription on/off\n     - Testing with very short audio inputs\n     - Testing with background noise\n   - Measure and document the latency improvement compared to previous implementation\n\n4. User Acceptance Testing:\n   - Create a test script for non-technical users to follow\n   - Collect feedback on the simplified workflow\n   - Compare user satisfaction metrics before and after the changes",

        "details": "This task involves fixing three specific issues in the transcription system:\n\n1. Remove Green Start/Clear Buttons from Assistant Window:\n   - The buttons were previously attempted to be removed but are still visible in the assistant window\n   - Locate the assistant window component (likely in `src/components/assistant/AssistantWindow.tsx` or similar)\n   - Identify why the previous removal attempt failed (possibly CSS specificity issues or conditional rendering logic)\n   - Implement a complete removal by:\n     ```typescript\n     // Check for any conditional rendering logic that might be keeping the buttons visible\n     {/* Remove or modify conditions like this */}\n     {isAssistantMode && !hideControls && <div className=\"control-buttons\">...</div>}\n     \n     // Ensure any CSS selectors are properly scoped and not being overridden\n     // Add more specific CSS selectors if needed\n     .assistant-window .control-buttons {\n       display: none !important; /* Force hiding with !important if necessary */\n     }\n     ```\n   - Verify the buttons are completely removed from the DOM, not just hidden with CSS\n\n2. Fix Gemini API Key Detection:\n   - The error \"Gemini API key not found in environment\" indicates the API key detection mechanism is failing\n   - Review the current API key loading mechanism in the application\n   - Check environment variable configuration in both development and production environments\n   - Implement a more robust API key detection system:\n     ```typescript\n     // Improve API key detection logic\n     const getGeminiApiKey = () => {\n       // Check multiple possible sources for the API key\n       const apiKey = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY || \n                      process.env.REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY || \n                      window.electron?.getGeminiApiKey();\n       \n       // Add better error handling with specific error messages\n       if (!apiKey) {\n         console.error('Gemini API key not found. Please check:');\n         console.error('1. Environment variables are properly set');\n         console.error('2. Electron IPC bridge is functioning correctly');\n         console.error('3. API key is stored in the correct location');\n       }\n       \n       return apiKey;\n     };\n     ```\n   - Add proper error handling to provide more informative messages when the API key is missing\n\n3. Replace ZeroLatencyTranscriptionDisplay with AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay:\n   - Completely hide the ZeroLatencyTranscriptionDisplay component\n   - Modify the AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay component to integrate with the zero-latency backend:\n     ```typescript\n     // In the parent component that renders the transcription displays\n     return (\n       <div className=\"transcription-container\">\n         {/* Remove or comment out the ZeroLatencyTranscriptionDisplay */}\n         {/* <ZeroLatencyTranscriptionDisplay {...props} /> */}\n         \n         {/* Use the AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay with zero-latency props */}\n         <AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay \n           {...props}\n           useZeroLatencyBackend={true} \n           streamingEnabled={true}\n         />\n       </div>\n     );\n     \n     // Modify AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay to handle zero-latency data\n     const AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay = ({ useZeroLatencyBackend, ...props }) => {\n       // Use the appropriate data source based on the flag\n       const transcriptionData = useZeroLatencyBackend \n         ? useZeroLatencyTranscriptionData() \n         : useStandardTranscriptionData();\n         \n       // Rest of the component implementation\n     };\n     ```\n   - Ensure the AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay properly handles the real-time data format from the zero-latency backend\n\nFor all three issues, implement comprehensive logging to help diagnose any remaining problems and verify the fixes are working correctly.",

Testing Gemini API Key Detection:\n   - Create unit tests for the API key detection function:\n     ```typescript\n     test('getGeminiApiKey should detect API key from environment variables', () => {\n       // Mock environment variables\n       process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY = 'test-api-key';\n       expect(getGeminiApiKey()).toBe('test-api-key');\n     });\n     \n     test('getGeminiApiKey should detect API key from Electron bridge', () => {\n       // Mock Electron bridge\n       window.electron = { getGeminiApiKey: () => 'electron-api-key' };\n       process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY = undefined;\n       expect(getGeminiApiKey()).toBe('electron-api-key');\n     });\n     ```\n   - Test the application with various API key configurations to ensure proper detection\n   - Verify error messages are clear and helpful when API key is missing\n   - Test in both development and production environments\n\n3. Testing AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay Integration:\n   - Verify ZeroLatencyTranscriptionDisplay is completely hidden in all application states\n   - Test that AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay correctly displays real-time transcription data:\n     ```typescript\n     test('AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay should render zero-latency data correctly', async () => {\n       // Mock zero-latency data\n       const mockData = [{ text: 'Test transcription', confidence: 0.95 }];\n       jest.mock('../hooks/useZeroLatencyTranscriptionData', () => () => mockData);\n       \n       render(<AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay useZeroLatencyBackend={true} />);\n       expect(await screen.findByText('Test transcription')).toBeInTheDocument();\n     });\n     ```\n   - Perform end-to-end testing with actual audio input to verify the complete pipeline works\n   - Test performance to ensure the AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay can handle rapid updates from the zero-latency backend\n   - Verify that all existing functionality of AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay is preserved\n\n4. Integration Testing:\n   - Perform a complete end-to-end test of the transcription system\n   - Verify all three fixes work together without introducing new issues\n   - Test the application under various network conditions and load scenarios",
