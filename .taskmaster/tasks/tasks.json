Create unified `GlassComponent` base with consistent variant/prop system\n2. Migrate all components to use CSS variables approach\n3. Implement React.memo across all glass components\n4. Consolidate GlassBox/GlassCard into single component\n5. Create glass component design system documentation\n</info added on 2025-08-05T09:43:30.159Z>",

The actual issue is in our client-side processing:\n\n1. Modify the `realTimeThreshold` in gemini-websocket-config.ts from 3000ms to 200ms to reduce batching intervals\n2. Update the transcription message processing pipeline to emit updates immediately rather than in large batches\n3. Implement a debouncing mechanism (50-100ms) in the UI update logic to balance responsiveness with performance\n4. Optimize the LiveTranscriptionDisplay component using React.memo and useMemo to handle frequent updates efficiently\n\nThis is a client-side optimization issue rather than a server-side WebSocket configuration problem.

Fix Gemini API Key Detection:\n   - The error \"Gemini API key not found in environment\" indicates the API key detection mechanism is failing\n   - Review the current API key loading mechanism in the application\n   - Check environment variable configuration in both development and production environments\n   - Implement a more robust API key detection system:\n     ```typescript\n     // Improve API key detection logic\n     const getGeminiApiKey = () => {\n       // Check multiple possible sources for the API key\n       const apiKey = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY || \n                      process.env.REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY || \n                      window.electron?.getGeminiApiKey();\n       \n       // Add better error handling with specific error messages\n       if (!apiKey) {\n         console.error('Gemini API key not found.

Replace ZeroLatencyTranscriptionDisplay with AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay:\n   - Completely hide the ZeroLatencyTranscriptionDisplay component\n   - Modify the AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay component to integrate with the zero-latency backend:\n     ```typescript\n     // In the parent component that renders the transcription displays\n     return (\n       <div className=\"transcription-container\">\n         {/* Remove or comment out the ZeroLatencyTranscriptionDisplay */}\n         {/* <ZeroLatencyTranscriptionDisplay {...props} /> */}\n         \n         {/* Use the AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay with zero-latency props */}\n         <AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay \n           {...props}\n           useZeroLatencyBackend={true} \n           streamingEnabled={true}\n         />\n       </div>\n     );\n     \n     // Modify AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay to handle zero-latency data\n     const AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay = ({ useZeroLatencyBackend, ...props }) => {\n       // Use the appropriate data source based on the flag\n       const transcriptionData = useZeroLatencyBackend \n         ? useZeroLatencyTranscriptionData() \n         : useStandardTranscriptionData();\n         \n       // Rest of the component implementation\n     };\n     ```\n   - Ensure the AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay properly handles the real-time data format from the zero-latency backend\n\nFor all three issues, implement comprehensive logging to help diagnose any remaining problems and verify the fixes are working correctly.",

Testing AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay Integration:\n   - Verify ZeroLatencyTranscriptionDisplay is completely hidden in all application states\n   - Test that AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay correctly displays real-time transcription data:\n     ```typescript\n     test('AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay should render zero-latency data correctly', async () => {\n       // Mock zero-latency data\n       const mockData = [{ text: 'Test transcription', confidence: 0.95 }];\n       jest.mock('../hooks/useZeroLatencyTranscriptionData', () => () => mockData);\n       \n       render(<AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay useZeroLatencyBackend={true} />);\n       expect(await screen.findByText('Test transcription')).toBeInTheDocument();\n     });\n     ```\n   - Perform end-to-end testing with actual audio input to verify the complete pipeline works\n   - Test performance to ensure the AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay can handle rapid updates from the zero-latency backend\n   - Verify that all existing functionality of AccumulativeTranscriptDisplay is preserved\n\n4. Integration Testing:\n   - Perform a complete end-to-end test of the transcription system\n   - Verify all three fixes work together without introducing new issues\n   - Test the application under various network conditions and load scenarios",
