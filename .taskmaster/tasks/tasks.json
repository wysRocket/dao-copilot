Update message format to use clientContent structure for turn management:\n   ```typescript\n   interface ClientMessage {\n     clientContent?: {\n       audio?: {\n         content: string; // base64 encoded audio\n       };\n       audioStreamEnd?: {};\n       turnCompletion?: {};\n     };\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Modify the system instruction to work in conversational mode:\n   ```typescript\n   function createSetupMessage(config: GeminiSetupConfig): SetupMessage {\n     return {\n       setup: {\n         model: config.model || \"models/gemini-2.0-flash-live-001\",\n         generationConfig: {\n           responseModalities: [\"TEXT\"],\n           conversationMode: true // Enable conversational mode\n         }\n       }\n     };\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. Add proper error handling for turn completion failures:\n   ```typescript\n   private handleTurnCompletionError(error: Error): void {\n     console.error('Turn completion failed:', error);\n     this.emit('turnCompletionError', error);\n     \n     // Attempt recovery if connection is still active\n     if (this.isConnected && this.autoRecovery) {\n       console.log('Attempting to recover from turn completion failure');\n       this.resetConversationState();\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. Implement a timeout mechanism for turn completion responses:\n   ```typescript\n   private setTurnCompletionTimeout(): void {\n     if (this.turnCompletionTimeout) {\n       clearTimeout(this.turnCompletionTimeout);\n     }\n     \n     this.turnCompletionTimeout = setTimeout(() => {\n       const error = new Error('Turn completion response timeout');\n       this.handleTurnCompletionError(error);\n     }, this.config.turnCompletionTimeoutMs || 10000);\n   }\n   ```\n\n7. Update the WebSocket message handler to process transcription responses:\n   ```typescript\n   private handleWebSocketMessage(event: MessageEvent): void {\n     try {\n       const response = JSON.parse(event.data);\n       \n       if (response.modelResponse?.content?.parts) {\n         // Clear turn completion timeout\n         if (this.turnCompletionTimeout) {\n           clearTimeout(this.turnCompletionTimeout);\n         }\n         \n         // Process transcription response\n         const transcription = this.extractTranscriptionFromResponse(response);\n         this.emit('transcription', transcription);\n       }\n     } catch (error) {\n       console.error('Error processing WebSocket message:', error);\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n8. Ensure proper sequencing in the main transcription flow:\n   ```typescript\n   async function performTranscription(audioStream: ReadableStream): Promise<void> {\n     const wsClient = new GeminiLiveWebSocketClient(config);\n     \n     try {\n       await wsClient.connect();\n       \n       // Process audio chunks\n       for await (const chunk of audioStream) {\n         await wsClient.sendAudioData(chunk);\n       }\n       \n       // Signal end of audio stream\n       await wsClient.sendAudioStreamEnd();\n       \n       // Send turn completion to trigger processing\n       await wsClient.sendTurnCompletion();\n     } catch (error) {\n       console.error('Transcription error:', error);\n     } finally {\n       await wsClient.disconnect();\n     }\n   }\n   ```",
