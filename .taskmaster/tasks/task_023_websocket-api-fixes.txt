# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Fallback Logic for Gemini Live API Model Access
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22, 20, 21, 13, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement proper fallback logic for handling the 'gemini-live-2.5-flash' model access issue, which requires 'Private GA' access that may not be available to all API keys.
# Details:
1. Investigate Access Requirements:
   - Document the specific 'Private GA' access requirements for the 'gemini-live-2.5-flash' model
   - Determine the process for requesting access through Google Cloud Console
   - Check if our current API keys have the necessary permissions
   - Identify any quota or billing implications of using this model

2. Implement Model Availability Detection:
   - Create a ModelAvailabilityChecker class that can probe for model access at runtime
   - Implement a lightweight test request that can determine if the current API key has access
   - Add caching of availability results to prevent repeated checks
   - Ensure the checker handles API errors gracefully without disrupting the application

3. Develop Robust Fallback Strategy:
   - Implement a ModelSelectionStrategy class that can dynamically choose the appropriate model
   - Create a prioritized list of fallback models (e.g., 'gemini-2.5-flash-live', 'gemini-1.5-flash')
   - Add configuration options to customize the fallback behavior
   - Implement graceful degradation that maintains core functionality with less capable models

4. Update WebSocket Connection Logic:
   - Modify the WebSocket connection initialization to use the ModelSelectionStrategy
   - Add proper error handling for model access denied scenarios
   - Implement automatic retry with fallback models when primary model access fails
   - Add detailed logging of model selection decisions for debugging

5. User Notification System:
   - Implement a notification mechanism to inform users when fallback models are being used
   - Create clear error messages that explain access limitations without technical jargon
   - Add guidance on how to request access to premium models where appropriate
   - Ensure notifications don't disrupt the user experience

6. Documentation and Configuration:
   - Update all relevant documentation to explain the model access requirements
   - Create a configuration guide for setting up proper model access
   - Document the fallback behavior and how to customize it
   - Add troubleshooting information for common access issues

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for the ModelAvailabilityChecker class
   - Test the ModelSelectionStrategy with various access scenarios
   - Verify correct fallback behavior when primary model is unavailable
   - Test error handling and retry logic with mock API responses
   - Ensure notification system works correctly across different access scenarios

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the complete flow from WebSocket initialization to transcription with various API keys
   - Verify seamless fallback to alternative models when access is denied
   - Test with intentionally restricted API keys to simulate access issues
   - Verify that performance metrics are correctly tracked during fallback scenarios

3. Access Request Testing:
   - Document and test the process for requesting 'Private GA' access
   - Verify that newly granted access is correctly detected by the system
   - Test the transition from fallback models to the primary model after access is granted

4. Error Scenario Testing:
   - Simulate various API error responses related to model access
   - Test temporary outages versus permanent access restrictions
   - Verify that the system doesn't get stuck in a loop when all models are unavailable
   - Test recovery when access is temporarily lost and then restored

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and compare transcription quality between primary and fallback models
   - Benchmark latency differences between models
   - Verify that fallback models meet minimum performance requirements
   - Test under high load to ensure fallback logic doesn't introduce bottlenecks

6. User Experience Testing:
   - Verify that notifications about model access are clear and helpful
   - Test that the application remains functional with fallback models
   - Ensure error messages provide actionable information
   - Collect feedback on the degraded experience to prioritize access requests
