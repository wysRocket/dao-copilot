# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement End-to-End Verification and Acceptance Testing
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 27, 28
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive end-to-end tests and acceptance criteria validation to ensure the transcription system meets all success metrics.
# Details:
Develop an end-to-end verification system that:
1. Implements tests for all success metrics: capture completeness, orphan rate, finalization latency, missed tail-on-stop, recovery success, duplicate artifacts, persistence durability
2. Creates reference audio and transcript datasets
3. Implements automated verification against acceptance criteria
4. Creates a dashboard for tracking metrics against targets
5. Implements continuous monitoring of key metrics
6. Creates regression test suite
7. Implements canary deployment verification

Code structure:
```typescript
interface SuccessMetrics {
  captureCompleteness: number; // Target: >= 99.95%
  orphanRate: number; // Target: < 0.05%
  finalizationLatency95Percentile: number; // Target: < 1.5s
  missedTailOnStop: number; // Target: < 100ms
  recoverySuccessRate: number; // Target: >= 99%
  duplicateArtifacts: number; // Target: 0 per 10k entries
  persistenceDurability: number; // Target: Lose < 1s recent audio only
}

class AcceptanceTester {
  private referenceDatasets: ReferenceDataset[];
  
  constructor(datasets: ReferenceDataset[]) {...}
  
  runAllTests(): Promise<TestResults> {...}
  measureCaptureCompleteness(): Promise<number> {...}
  measureOrphanRate(): Promise<number> {...}
  measureFinalizationLatency(): Promise<number> {...}
  measureMissedTailOnStop(): Promise<number> {...}
  measureRecoverySuccess(): Promise<number> {...}
  measureDuplicateArtifacts(): Promise<number> {...}
  measurePersistenceDurability(): Promise<number> {...}
  generateReport(results: TestResults): AcceptanceReport {...}
}

interface ReferenceDataset {
  audio: AudioData;
  referenceTranscript: string;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}

interface TestResults {
  metrics: SuccessMetrics;
  passed: boolean;
  failedTests: string[];
  rawData: Record<string, any>;
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify accuracy of each metric measurement
2. Test with various reference datasets
3. Verify automated acceptance criteria validation
4. Test dashboard accuracy
5. Verify continuous monitoring
6. Test regression detection
7. Verify canary deployment validation
8. End-to-end system test with real-world usage patterns
