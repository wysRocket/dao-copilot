# Task ID: 11
# Title: Fix Stack Overflow in WebSocket Transcription System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Identify and fix the infinite recursion causing "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors in performTranscription and transcribeAudioViaWebSocket functions, which is blocking all WebSocket functionality.
# Details:
1. Analyze the call stack in the performTranscription and transcribeAudioViaWebSocket functions to identify the recursive pattern causing the stack overflow.
2. Review all function calls within these methods, paying special attention to callback functions, promises, and event handlers that might create circular references.
3. Check for direct recursion (function calling itself without proper termination condition) and indirect recursion (function A calls function B which eventually calls function A again).
4. Examine event listeners that might be duplicated or not properly removed, potentially causing multiple callback executions.
5. Implement the fix by:
   - Adding proper termination conditions to recursive functions
   - Restructuring callback chains to avoid circular references
   - Ensuring event listeners are properly managed (added once, removed when no longer needed)
   - Converting recursive algorithms to iterative approaches where appropriate
   - Implementing proper error boundaries to prevent cascading failures
6. Add defensive programming techniques:
   - Add depth counters to prevent excessive recursion
   - Implement circuit breakers for recursive operations
   - Add validation checks before recursive calls
7. Document the root cause of the issue and the implemented solution in code comments and the project documentation.
8. Update any related error handling to provide more descriptive messages if similar issues occur in the future.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests specifically targeting the fixed functions with various input scenarios:
   - Normal operation cases
   - Edge cases that previously triggered the stack overflow
   - Boundary conditions with large data payloads
   - Rapid successive calls to test concurrency handling

2. Implement stress tests that:
   - Make repeated calls to the transcription functions
   - Simulate high-frequency WebSocket events
   - Test with varying network conditions
   - Verify memory usage remains stable during extended operation

3. Add instrumentation to measure:
   - Call stack depth during operation
   - Memory usage patterns
   - Function execution time

4. Create integration tests that verify:
   - End-to-end WebSocket transcription flow works correctly
   - Error handling properly manages exceptional conditions
   - No regression in related WebSocket functionality

5. Verify logging is comprehensive by:
   - Checking that appropriate debug information is recorded
   - Confirming error states are properly logged
   - Ensuring stack traces are captured for any remaining errors

6. Conduct manual testing of the WebSocket transcription system with real audio input to verify the fix resolves the issue in production-like environments.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Call Stack and Identify Recursion Patterns [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Examine the call stack in performTranscription and transcribeAudioViaWebSocket functions to identify the specific patterns causing the stack overflow error.
### Details:
1. Use browser developer tools or Node.js debugging to capture the full call stack when the error occurs.
2. Map out the function call sequence leading to the overflow.
3. Identify if the issue is direct recursion (self-calling) or indirect recursion (circular dependency).
4. Document all callback chains, promise handlers, and event listeners involved in the recursion.
5. Create a visual diagram of the call flow to pinpoint exact recursion points.
6. Check for event listeners that might be duplicated or not properly removed.

## 2. Fix Circular References in Callback Chains [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Restructure callback chains and promise handlers to eliminate circular references that lead to infinite recursion.
### Details:
1. Refactor callback patterns to use proper termination conditions.
2. Replace nested callbacks with promise chains or async/await patterns where appropriate.
3. Implement guards against re-entry into critical sections of code.
4. Ensure all promise rejection scenarios are properly handled.
5. Add state tracking to prevent redundant processing of the same data.
6. Implement proper cleanup of resources after processing completes.

## 3. Implement Event Listener Management [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Fix issues with WebSocket event listeners that may be causing duplicate registrations or failing to unregister, leading to cascading calls.
### Details:
1. Audit all event listener registrations in the WebSocket connection lifecycle.
2. Implement a tracking mechanism to ensure listeners are registered only once.
3. Add explicit cleanup code to remove listeners when they're no longer needed.
4. Use named functions instead of anonymous functions for listeners to facilitate proper removal.
5. Implement a centralized event management system if multiple components need to listen to the same events.
6. Add validation to prevent attaching listeners to already closed connections.

## 4. Add Recursion Depth Tracking and Circuit Breakers [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Implement safety mechanisms to prevent excessive recursion depth and add circuit breakers to halt processing when potential infinite loops are detected.
### Details:
1. Add a recursion depth counter to key functions that tracks call depth.
2. Implement maximum depth thresholds with appropriate error handling when exceeded.
3. Add circuit breaker pattern to abort processing after a configurable number of iterations.
4. Implement exponential backoff for retry mechanisms to prevent rapid recursive retries.
5. Add runtime assertions to validate function parameters and state before proceeding with recursive operations.
6. Create a recovery mechanism that can reset the system to a known good state when circuit breakers trigger.

## 5. Convert Recursive Algorithms to Iterative Approaches [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Refactor any inherently recursive algorithms in the transcription system to use iterative approaches that don't consume stack space.
### Details:
1. Identify algorithms that use recursion for traversal or processing.
2. Reimplement these using loops and explicit stack data structures where needed.
3. For complex operations, implement a state machine approach that can process data incrementally.
4. Use generators or async iterators for processing large streams of audio data.
5. Implement chunking strategies to break large processing tasks into smaller units.
6. Ensure all iterative implementations maintain the same functional behavior as the original recursive versions.

## 6. Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5
### Description: Enhance error handling throughout the WebSocket transcription system and document the root causes and fixes for the stack overflow issues.
### Details:
1. Add specific error types for different failure scenarios in the WebSocket transcription flow.
2. Implement more descriptive error messages that include context about the failure.
3. Add logging at key points in the transcription process to aid in future debugging.
4. Create recovery paths for common error scenarios without requiring connection reestablishment.
5. Document the root causes of the stack overflow in code comments and project documentation.
6. Update architecture diagrams to reflect the new, more robust implementation.
