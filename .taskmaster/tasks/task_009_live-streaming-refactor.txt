# Description: Create comprehensive testing suite for streaming transcription functionality including unit, integration, and performance tests.
# Details:
## Problem Analysis
Current streaming transcription implementation lacks comprehensive testing, making it difficult to ensure reliability and catch regressions during development.

## Testing Categories

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - StreamingTextRenderer component behavior
   - TextStreamBuffer functionality
   - TranscriptionSourceManager routing logic
   - WebSocketTranscriptionRouter decision making
   - Animation timing and rendering

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - End-to-end WebSocket to animation flow
   - IPC communication between main and renderer processes
   - Context integration between streaming and static systems
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - State transitions and lifecycle management

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Animation frame rate consistency
   - Memory usage during long sessions
   - CPU utilization during active streaming
   - Response time for WebSocket transcriptions
   - Concurrent streaming handling

4. **Accessibility Tests**:
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Keyboard navigation functionality
   - ARIA attributes and announcements
   - Reduced motion preference handling
   - High contrast mode support

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Configure Jest with React Testing Library
   - Set up Playwright for E2E tests
   - Create mock WebSocket server for testing
   - Add performance benchmarking tools

2. **Create Test Utilities**:
   - Mock transcription data generators
   - WebSocket event simulators
   - Animation testing helpers
   - Performance measurement utilities
   - Accessibility testing helpers

3. **Write Comprehensive Test Suites**:
   - Component rendering and behavior tests
   - State management integration tests
   - WebSocket communication tests
   - Error scenario simulation tests
   - Performance regression tests

4. **Add Continuous Testing**:
   - Automated test runs on PR creation
   - Performance benchmarking in CI
   - Accessibility compliance checking
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing
   - Memory leak detection

## Files to Create
- `/src/components/__tests__/StreamingTextRenderer.test.tsx`
- `/src/services/__tests__/TextStreamBuffer.test.ts`
- `/src/contexts/__tests__/StreamingTextContext.test.tsx`
- `/tests/integration/streaming-transcription.test.ts`
- `/tests/performance/animation-performance.test.ts`
- `/tests/accessibility/streaming-a11y.test.ts`

## Test Scenarios
```typescript
describe('Streaming Transcription Flow', () => {
  it('should route WebSocket transcriptions to streaming renderer')
  it('should fallback to batch mode on WebSocket failure')
  it('should maintain 60fps during character animation')
  it('should clean up resources after streaming completion')
  it('should handle concurrent streaming requests')
  it('should respect user accessibility preferences')
})
```

## Performance Benchmarks
- Animation frame rate: > 55fps consistently
- Memory usage growth: < 1MB per 100 transcriptions
- WebSocket response time: < 200ms average
- Component render time: < 10ms per update
- Error recovery time: < 1 second

## Success Criteria
- 100% test coverage for critical streaming components
- All performance benchmarks met consistently
- Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- Accessibility compliance verified
- Reliable CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
