# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize WebSocket performance and implement monitoring for connection health and metrics.
# Details:
1. Implement connection health monitoring:
   ```typescript
   import { HealthCheck } from '../utils/HealthCheck';

   class WebSocketManager {
     private healthCheck: HealthCheck;

     constructor() {
       // ...
       this.healthCheck = new HealthCheck();
     }

     private monitorConnectionHealth() {
       setInterval(() => {
         const health = this.healthCheck.checkConnection(this.ws);
         // Log or report health status
       }, 30000); // Check every 30 seconds
     }
   }
   ```
2. Implement performance metrics collection:
   - Message round-trip time
   - Connection uptime
   - Error rates
3. Optimize message buffering for memory efficiency
4. Implement connection pooling for handling multiple concurrent sessions
5. Add logging for important events and metrics

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for HealthCheck class
2. Verify accuracy of performance metrics
3. Load testing to ensure performance under concurrent sessions
4. Monitor memory usage during long-running sessions
5. Verify logging of important events and metrics
