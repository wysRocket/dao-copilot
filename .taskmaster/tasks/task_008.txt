# Task ID: 8
# Title: Optimize Performance for Continuous Operation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations for efficient memory management, CPU usage, and network bandwidth utilization during continuous streaming.
# Details:
1. Implement efficient memory management for audio buffers.
2. Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects.
3. Optimize CPU usage by using Web Workers for intensive tasks.
4. Implement lazy loading and code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense.
5. Use the Compression Streams API for efficient data compression before transmission.
6. Implement request batching for non-critical API calls.
7. Use IndexedDB (with idb-keyval library version 6.x) for client-side storage of large datasets.
8. Implement virtual scrolling for large transcription histories.
9. Use the Performance API to measure and optimize critical paths.

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark memory usage during extended recording sessions.
2. Profile CPU usage and optimize hot paths.
3. Measure and assert on network bandwidth usage.
4. Perform load testing with simulated continuous operation.
5. Use Chrome DevTools for performance profiling and optimization.
