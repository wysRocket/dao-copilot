# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Live Streaming UI with Visual Separation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement visual separation between live streaming content and static transcripts with proper transitions and UI indicators.
# Details:
## Problem Analysis
Current UI doesn't clearly distinguish between live streaming content and historical transcripts, causing confusion and poor user experience.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Design Live Streaming UI Section**:
   - Create dedicated streaming area above static transcripts
   - Add visual indicators for live transcription status
   - Implement animated borders or highlights for active streaming
   - Design loading states and progress indicators

2. **Implement Transition Animations**:
   - Smooth animation when streaming text completes
   - Fade/slide transition from streaming area to static list
   - Visual feedback for transcription completion
   - Handle multiple overlapping streams gracefully

3. **Status Indicators and Feedback**:
   - Add "Live Transcribing..." indicator during active streams
   - Show transcription source (WebSocket, Batch, etc.)
   - Display confidence scores for completed transcriptions
   - Add timestamp formatting for better readability

4. **Layout and Styling**:
   - Separate streaming area with distinct styling
   - Use glass morphism effects consistent with app theme
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Accessibility features (screen reader announcements)

## Files to Create/Modify
- Create `/src/components/LiveStreamingArea.tsx` - Dedicated streaming UI
- Create `/src/components/TranscriptionStatusIndicator.tsx` - Status display
- `/src/components/TranscriptDisplay.tsx` - Update layout with separate areas
- Create `/src/styles/live-streaming-ui.css` - Streaming-specific styles

## UI Specifications
- **Streaming Area**: Fixed height section at top with animated content
- **Transition Zone**: Visual separator with completion animations
- **Static Area**: Scrollable list of historical transcripts
- **Status Bar**: Compact indicator showing current streaming status

## Visual Design Elements
- Pulsing border for active streaming
- Gradient backgrounds for streaming vs. static areas
- Smooth fade transitions (300ms duration)
- Consistent glass morphism styling
- Color coding for different transcription sources

## Success Criteria
- Clear visual separation between streaming and static content
- Smooth transitions when streaming completes
- Intuitive status indicators and feedback
- Responsive design across devices
- Accessibility compliance maintained

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Live Streaming Area Layout [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a dedicated live streaming area that visually separates from static transcripts
### Details:
Create a fixed-height streaming area at the top of the transcript display with distinct visual styling, animated borders, and clear separation from the scrollable static transcript list below.

## 2. Implement Completion Transition Animations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create smooth transition animations when streaming text completes and moves to static transcript list
### Details:
Implement fade/slide animations when live streaming text finishes, transitioning from the streaming area to the static transcript list with proper timing and visual feedback.

## 3. Create Status Indicators and Feedback [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create visual status indicators and feedback components for live transcription activity
### Details:
Design and implement status indicators including 'Live Transcribing...' messages, transcription source badges, confidence scores, and animated progress indicators for active streaming.

## 4. Apply Styling and Responsive Design [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply glass morphism styling and responsive design to live streaming UI components
### Details:
Create consistent glass morphism effects for the streaming area, implement responsive design for different screen sizes, and ensure accessibility features are maintained across all UI improvements.
