# Task ID: 3
# Title: Refactor CustomTitleBar Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Redesign the CustomTitleBar component using glassmorphism effects and the new dark theme.
# Details:
1. Import necessary components from @rdev/liquid-glass-react
2. Refactor CustomTitleBar.tsx to use GlassBox component for the main container
3. Apply appropriate blur and opacity settings
4. Implement glass effect for the Ask AI button
5. Ensure window controls (minimize, maximize, close) are styled correctly
6. Maintain existing functionality for dragging the window
7. Implement subtle hover effects for interactive elements

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the title bar renders correctly with glass effects
2. Test window dragging functionality
3. Ensure all buttons (Ask AI, window controls) work as expected
4. Check that the title bar is responsive and adapts to different window sizes
5. Validate that the component maintains its appearance and functionality across different operating systems
