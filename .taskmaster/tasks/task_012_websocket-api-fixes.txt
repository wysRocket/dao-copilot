# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Memory-Efficient Audio Chunk Processing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 11, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Redesign the audio chunk processing logic in the WebSocket transcription system to prevent stack overflow errors during streaming, focusing on iterative approaches and efficient memory management.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current implementation of performTranscription and transcribeAudioViaWebSocket functions to identify the recursive pattern causing stack overflow.

2. Refactor the audio chunk processing logic:
   a. Replace recursive calls with an iterative approach using a queue or buffer to store incoming audio chunks.
   b. Implement a producer-consumer pattern where the WebSocket connection acts as the producer, and a separate worker thread or async function acts as the consumer.
   c. Use a circular buffer or ring buffer data structure to efficiently manage incoming audio chunks without excessive memory allocation.

3. Optimize memory usage:
   a. Implement object pooling for frequently created objects to reduce garbage collection pressure.
   b. Use typed arrays (e.g., Float32Array) for audio data to improve memory efficiency and performance.
   c. Consider using Web Workers for offloading heavy processing tasks to prevent blocking the main thread.

4. Implement backpressure mechanisms:
   a. Add flow control to the WebSocket connection to prevent overwhelming the transcription pipeline.
   b. Use the ReadableStream and WritableStream APIs to create a proper streaming pipeline with built-in backpressure support.

5. Error handling and recovery:
   a. Implement robust error handling to gracefully recover from processing errors without crashing the entire system.
   b. Add circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures in case of persistent issues.

6. Performance monitoring:
   a. Integrate with existing logging and monitoring systems (from Task 5) to track memory usage, processing time, and error rates.
   b. Implement custom performance metrics for the audio chunk processing pipeline.

7. Code example for iterative processing:

   ```javascript
   class AudioChunkProcessor {
     constructor() {
       this.chunkQueue = [];
       this.isProcessing = false;
     }

     async addChunk(chunk) {
       this.chunkQueue.push(chunk);
       if (!this.isProcessing) {
         await this.processChunks();
       }
     }

     async processChunks() {
       this.isProcessing = true;
       while (this.chunkQueue.length > 0) {
         const chunk = this.chunkQueue.shift();
         await this.processSingleChunk(chunk);
       }
       this.isProcessing = false;
     }

     async processingleChunk(chunk) {
       // Implement non-recursive transcription logic here
     }
   }
   ```

8. Update the WebSocket event handlers to use the new AudioChunkProcessor:

   ```javascript
   const processor = new AudioChunkProcessor();

   webSocket.onmessage = async (event) => {
     const audioChunk = parseAudioChunk(event.data);
     await processor.addChunk(audioChunk);
   };
   ```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   a. Create unit tests for the new AudioChunkProcessor class, covering all methods and edge cases.
   b. Test the chunk queuing mechanism with various input sizes and frequencies.
   c. Verify that the processChunks method correctly handles the queue in a first-in-first-out manner.
   d. Test error handling and recovery mechanisms.

2. Integration Testing:
   a. Set up an end-to-end test environment that simulates the WebSocket connection and audio streaming.
   b. Verify that the system can handle continuous streaming of audio chunks without stack overflow errors.
   c. Test with different audio input sizes, from small chunks to large streams.
   d. Ensure that the transcription results are accurate and complete for various audio inputs.

3. Performance Testing:
   a. Conduct stress tests by simulating high-volume, rapid audio chunk submissions.
   b. Monitor memory usage during extended streaming sessions to ensure there are no memory leaks.
   c. Measure and compare transcription latency before and after the implementation to ensure performance improvements.

4. Concurrency Testing:
   a. Test multiple simultaneous WebSocket connections to ensure the system can handle concurrent transcription requests.
   b. Verify that backpressure mechanisms work correctly under high load.

5. Error Injection and Recovery Testing:
   a. Deliberately introduce errors in the audio processing pipeline to test error handling and recovery.
   b. Verify that the circuit breaker patterns prevent system-wide failures during persistent error conditions.

6. Browser Compatibility Testing:
   a. Test the implementation across different browsers and versions to ensure consistent behavior.
   b. Pay special attention to memory usage and performance in mobile browsers.

7. Monitoring and Logging Verification:
   a. Confirm that the new implementation correctly integrates with existing logging and monitoring systems.
   b. Verify that custom performance metrics are being recorded and are accessible for analysis.

8. Regression Testing:
   a. Run the existing test suite for the WebSocket transcription system to ensure no regressions in functionality.
   b. Verify that the fix doesn't introduce new issues in other parts of the system.

9. Long-running Stability Test:
   a. Set up a long-running test (e.g., 24 hours) with continuous audio streaming to verify system stability over time.
   b. Monitor for any degradation in performance or increase in error rates during extended operation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Current Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Examine the performTranscription and transcribeAudioViaWebSocket functions to identify recursive patterns causing stack overflow.
### Details:
Review the existing codebase, focusing on the audio chunk processing logic. Document the recursive calls and their impact on memory usage. Identify specific areas where stack overflow errors occur.
<info added on 2025-07-24T13:31:14.318Z>
Analysis of recursive patterns causing stack overflow in the audio processing system:

1. **Main Call Chain**: 
   - transcribeAudio() → transcribeAudioViaWebSocket() → performTranscription()

2. **Recursive Pattern 1 - Direct Call Chain**:
   - Line 86: transcribeAudio() calls transcribeAudioViaWebSocket(wavData, options)
   - Line 474: transcribeAudioViaWebSocket() calls performTranscription(audioData, options)
   - This creates a linear call chain that accumulates on the stack

3. **Recursive Pattern 2 - Compatibility Layer**:
   - Line 1293: transcribeAudioWithCompatibility() calls transcribeAudioViaWebSocket()
   - This adds another layer to the call stack depth

4. **Recursive Pattern 3 - Error Retry Logic**:
   - Error handling in performTranscription() (lines 1000-1050) may trigger retries
   - WebSocket reconnection attempts can cause repeated function calls
   - Event handler callbacks accumulate on the stack

5. **Stack Depth Tracking Found**:
   - transcriptionCallDepth variable tracks call depth
   - MAX_CALL_DEPTH constant set to prevent infinite recursion
   - StackOverflowError class exists for proper error handling

6. **Memory-Intensive Operations**:
   - Large audio buffer processing in chunks (lines 740-800)
   - Base64 encoding of audio data multiple times
   - Event listener accumulation on WebSocket client

7. **Specific Problem Areas**:
   - Audio chunk streaming loop (lines 755-805) with synchronous processing
   - Multiple event handlers registered without proper cleanup
   - Recursive error handling that may retrigger the same functions

Root cause: The current architecture uses deep function call chains instead of iterative processing, causing stack overflow when processing large audio files or during error conditions.

# DESIGN COMPLETE: Iterative Processing Approach

The design for the memory-efficient audio chunk processing system is now complete with the following components and principles:

## Core Components Created:

1. **AudioChunkProcessor.ts** - Main iterative processing engine:
   - Replaces recursive chunk processing with event-driven iterative loops
   - Controlled concurrency (2-3 chunks max) to prevent memory spikes
   - Memory-efficient streaming with 32KB chunk size optimization
   - Retry logic using iterative loops instead of recursive calls
   - Built-in cancellation, timeout handling, and resource cleanup
   - Event emitter for progress monitoring and error handling

2. **WebSocketTranscriptionAdapter.ts** - Integration layer:
   - Drop-in replacement for transcribeAudioViaWebSocket() function
   - Integrates AudioChunkProcessor with existing WebSocket infrastructure
   - Provides transcribeAudioViaWebSocketIterative() as migration function
   - Proper WebSocket lifecycle management and event handling
   - Enhanced error reporting with chunk-level granularity

3. **MIGRATION_PLAN.md** - Comprehensive migration strategy:
   - 3-phase rollout: Parallel → Gradual → Full migration
   - Feature flag system for safe deployment
   - Detailed testing strategy and rollback procedures
   - Performance monitoring and success criteria
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Key Design Principles:

1. **Iterative Architecture**: All processing uses loops instead of recursive function calls
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Controlled chunk processing prevents memory accumulation
3. **Event-Driven**: Proper event handling with cleanup prevents listener leaks
4. **Fail-Safe**: Feature flag system allows immediate rollback to recursive implementation
5. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and logging for performance tracking

## Stack Overflow Prevention:

- **Call Depth Elimination**: No more transcribeAudio → transcribeAudioViaWebSocket → performTranscription chain
- **Iterative Loops**: Chunk processing uses for/while loops instead of recursive calls
- **Controlled Concurrency**: Maximum 2-3 concurrent operations to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Event Cleanup**: Proper removal of event listeners prevents memory leaks
- **Timeout Handling**: Built-in timeouts prevent infinite processing scenarios

The design is now ready for implementation in Task 12.3.
