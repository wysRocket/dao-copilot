# Task ID: 20
# Title: Debug Gemini API Transcription Response Issue
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 13, 17, 18, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Investigate and fix the critical issue where the Gemini Live API is not returning any transcription text despite successful WebSocket connection and audio transmission.
# Details:
1. Diagnostic Investigation:
   - Add detailed logging to track the complete lifecycle of WebSocket messages, focusing specifically on:
     * Request payload format and headers sent to Gemini API
     * All incoming WebSocket message types (not just 'geminiResponse')
     * Timing between audio transmission and expected responses
   - Verify API key and authentication are correctly configured for transcription permissions
   - Check if there are any rate limiting or quota issues affecting the transcription service
   - Review WebSocket protocol compliance, ensuring proper message framing and encoding

2. API Integration Analysis:
   - Compare the current implementation against the latest Gemini Live API documentation
   - Verify audio format parameters match exactly what the API expects (16kHz PCM)
   - Check if any required headers or metadata are missing in the audio transmission
   - Test with different audio sample rates and formats to identify potential compatibility issues
   - Examine if any recent API changes could have affected the transcription response format

3. Implementation Fixes:
   - Update the WebSocket message handler to properly process all response types from Gemini API
   - Implement more robust error detection for silent API failures (responses with status 200 but no content)
   - Add explicit handling for different response scenarios (interim results, final results, errors)
   - Implement a timeout mechanism that detects when no transcription is received within expected timeframe
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff for failed transcription attempts

4. Testing and Validation:
   - Create a simplified test harness that isolates the WebSocket transcription flow
   - Test with pre-recorded audio samples of known content to verify transcription accuracy
   - Compare results with alternative transcription services to validate audio quality is sufficient
   - Document any API limitations or requirements discovered during testing

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for the updated WebSocket message handlers
   - Test with mock WebSocket responses simulating various API response scenarios
   - Verify correct handling of empty responses, malformed data, and timeout conditions
   - Test the retry and recovery mechanisms under different failure conditions

2. Integration Testing:
   - Set up an isolated test environment that connects to the actual Gemini Live API
   - Test with controlled audio samples of varying lengths, languages, and clarity
   - Verify transcription results are received and processed correctly
   - Measure response times and success rates under different network conditions
   - Test with different audio input devices to ensure compatibility

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Test the complete flow from audio capture to transcription display in the UI
   - Verify that transcription text appears correctly after the fixes
   - Test edge cases like very quiet audio, background noise, and different accents
   - Validate that the system recovers gracefully from temporary API disruptions

4. Monitoring and Validation:
   - Implement temporary enhanced logging in production to verify fix effectiveness
   - Monitor API response success rates before and after deployment
   - Track key metrics: time to first transcription, completion rate, error frequency
   - Create a dashboard to visualize WebSocket transcription performance

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Comprehensive WebSocket Message Logging [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add detailed logging throughout the WebSocket lifecycle to capture all message types, request payloads, and response timing for debugging the Gemini API transcription issue.
### Details:
Enhance the existing WebSocket client with comprehensive logging: 1) Log complete request payloads with headers and authentication details (masking sensitive data), 2) Create separate log categories for different WebSocket message types (connection, audio transmission, API responses), 3) Add timestamps to measure latency between audio transmission and response receipt, 4) Log all incoming message types from Gemini API, not just 'geminiResponse' events, 5) Implement a debug mode flag that can be toggled to enable/disable verbose logging.

## 2. Validate API Configuration and Audio Format Compatibility [done]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Verify that API authentication, permissions, and audio format parameters match Gemini Live API requirements for transcription services.
### Details:
1) Review API key configuration and verify it has transcription permissions enabled, 2) Check for any quota limitations or rate limiting issues by examining API usage metrics, 3) Validate audio format parameters against Gemini API documentation (ensure 16kHz PCM format is correctly specified), 4) Create a test with different audio sample rates to identify potential format incompatibilities, 5) Compare current implementation against latest Gemini Live API documentation to identify any discrepancies in request structure or required parameters.

## 3. Enhance WebSocket Message Handler for All Response Types [done]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2
### Description: Update the WebSocket message handler to properly process all response types from Gemini API, including interim results, final results, and error conditions.
### Details:
1) Refactor the WebSocket message handler to explicitly handle all possible response types from Gemini API (not just 'geminiResponse'), 2) Implement proper parsing for interim and final transcription results, 3) Add explicit error detection for silent API failures (responses with status 200 but no content), 4) Create a timeout mechanism that triggers an error when no transcription is received within an expected timeframe, 5) Implement a state machine to track the expected sequence of messages and detect deviations from normal flow.

## 4. Implement Retry Logic and Create Isolated Test Harness [done]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Add robust retry mechanisms for failed transcription attempts and create a simplified test environment to validate the complete transcription flow.
### Details:
1) Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed transcription attempts, 2) Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent repeated failures when API is unavailable, 3) Create a simplified test harness that isolates the WebSocket transcription flow from the rest of the application, 4) Test with pre-recorded audio samples of known content to verify transcription accuracy, 5) Document all API limitations and requirements discovered during testing, 6) Compare results with alternative transcription services to validate that audio quality is sufficient.
