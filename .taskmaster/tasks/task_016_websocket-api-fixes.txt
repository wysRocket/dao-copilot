# Task ID: 16
# Title: Comprehensive Testing and Monitoring for Stack Overflow Prevention
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12, 13, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive testing and monitoring systems to detect, prevent, and alert on potential infinite recursion and stack overflow conditions before they cause system failures.
# Details:
1. Implement stack trace analysis and monitoring:
   - Create a StackTraceAnalyzer utility class that can capture and analyze call stacks
   - Implement detection for suspicious patterns like repetitive function calls
   - Add configurable thresholds for maximum call depth and repetition counts
   - Create hooks to integrate with existing error handling mechanisms

2. Develop runtime monitoring for stack usage:
   - Implement a StackMonitor class that tracks function call depths across the application
   - Add instrumentation to high-risk recursive functions identified in Task 11
   - Create memory usage tracking for critical paths in the audio processing pipeline
   - Implement warning systems that trigger before critical thresholds are reached

3. Create early warning notification system:
   - Develop a warning mechanism that fires when stack depth approaches configurable thresholds
   - Implement graceful degradation options when potential stack issues are detected
   - Add logging with detailed context information for later analysis
   - Create dashboard visualization for stack usage patterns over time

4. Enhance the CircuitBreaker implementation from Task 13:
   - Add stack overflow detection as a circuit-breaking condition
   - Implement stack depth as a health metric for the circuit breaker
   - Create recovery strategies specific to stack overflow scenarios
   - Add telemetry to track near-miss stack overflow incidents

5. Integrate with AudioChunkQueueManager from Task 15:
   - Add monitoring hooks in the queue processing logic
   - Implement adaptive throttling based on current stack usage
   - Create fallback processing paths for high-load scenarios
   - Add correlation between queue size and stack depth metrics

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for the StackTraceAnalyzer utility
   - Test all threshold configurations and detection mechanisms
   - Verify that warning systems trigger at appropriate thresholds
   - Test the integration with CircuitBreaker and error handling systems
   - Create mock scenarios that simulate various stack overflow conditions

2. Integration Testing:
   - Develop test scenarios that deliberately create deep call stacks
   - Test the entire audio processing pipeline with simulated high-load conditions
   - Verify that early warning systems trigger before actual failures occur
   - Test the interaction between stack monitoring and the AudioChunkQueueManager
   - Verify that circuit breaker trips appropriately for stack-related issues

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure the overhead of stack monitoring in various scenarios
   - Optimize the monitoring system to minimize performance impact
   - Test with production-level loads to ensure monitoring doesn't degrade performance
   - Verify that stack analysis doesn't itself cause stack or memory issues

4. Chaos Testing:
   - Create controlled chaos tests that inject stack-consuming operations
   - Test recovery mechanisms after deliberate stack overflow conditions
   - Verify system resilience when multiple components experience stack pressure
   - Test the system's ability to maintain partial functionality during stack issues

5. Monitoring Validation:
   - Create a test dashboard to visualize stack monitoring metrics
   - Verify that alerts and notifications work correctly for different thresholds
   - Test log output for stack-related warnings and errors
   - Validate that stack trace information is properly captured for analysis
