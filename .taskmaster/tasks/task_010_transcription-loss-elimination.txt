# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Configuration and Feature Flag System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a flexible configuration system with feature flags to control system behavior and enable safe rollout.
# Details:
Develop a TranscriptionConfig class that manages all configurable aspects of the system. Implement feature flags for: enableWAL, enableFallbackReplay, orphanRecoveryIntervalMs, finalizeTimeoutMs, audioPreRollMs. Create a configuration provider that can load settings from environment variables or an in-app dev panel. Implement runtime toggle capability for safe feature switching without restart. Add validation for configuration values to prevent invalid settings. Create a configuration dashboard for easy visualization and modification of settings in development and testing environments.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test configuration loading from different sources (environment, dev panel). Test validation of configuration values with valid and invalid inputs. Create integration tests that verify system behavior changes appropriately when feature flags are toggled. Test the runtime toggle capability to ensure it safely updates system behavior. Verify configuration persistence across page reloads.
