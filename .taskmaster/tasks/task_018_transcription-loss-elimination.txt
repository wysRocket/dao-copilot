# Task ID: 18
# Title: Develop Connection Management and Audio Pre-Roll Buffer
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a connection pool with warm connections and heartbeat verification, plus an audio pre-roll buffer to prevent clipping of the first utterance.
# Details:
Create a robust connection management system with:
1. Implement a connection pool that maintains warm WebSocket connections
2. Add heartbeat verification every 15 seconds to ensure connections are alive
3. Create an audio pre-roll buffer that retains 500ms of audio before detected speech
4. Implement queuing mechanism for partials when connection isn't ready
5. Add flush logic to send queued partials within 1s window once connection is ready
6. Implement connection status tracking and events
7. Add graceful degradation when connections cannot be established

Code structure:
```typescript
class ConnectionManager {
  private connections: WebSocket[];
  private heartbeatInterval: number;
  private connectionStatus: 'ready' | 'connecting' | 'degraded';
  
  constructor(options: {
    poolSize: number;
    heartbeatIntervalMs: number;
  }) {...}
  
  getConnection(): WebSocket {...}
  verifyConnections(): void {...}
  handleDisconnect(conn: WebSocket): void {...}
}

class AudioPreRollBuffer {
  private buffer: AudioData[];
  private bufferSizeMs: number;
  
  constructor(bufferSizeMs: number = 500) {...}
  
  addAudioChunk(chunk: AudioData): void {...}
  getPreRollAudio(): AudioData {...}
  clear(): void {...}
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for connection pool management
2. Test heartbeat verification and reconnection logic
3. Verify audio pre-roll buffer captures correct amount of audio
4. Test partial queuing and flushing when connection becomes ready
5. Simulate network conditions to test connection status transitions
6. Integration tests with mock audio input to verify end-to-end flow
7. Stress test with rapid connection cycling
