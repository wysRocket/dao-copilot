# Task ID: 4
# Title: Refactor Unified Transcription State Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor state management to use single source of truth for transcription data with clear separation between streaming and static content.
# Details:
## Problem Analysis
Current implementation has multiple overlapping state systems causing conflicts and performance issues:
- Multiple TextStreamBuffer instances
- Conflicting useState hooks
- Poor separation between streaming and static state

## Implementation Steps
1. **Create Unified State Manager**:
   - Create TranscriptionStateManager class
   - Implement single source of truth pattern
   - Add clear state separation for streaming vs. static content
   - Implement proper state transitions

2. **Refactor Context Architecture**:
   - Consolidate StreamingTextContext and MultiWindowContext transcription logic
   - Create clear interfaces between contexts
   - Implement proper context composition
   - Add state synchronization mechanisms

3. **Implement State Lifecycle Management**:
   - Define clear state transitions: incoming → streaming → static
   - Implement proper cleanup for completed streams
   - Add memory management for long sessions
   - Handle edge cases and error states

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Eliminate duplicate state storage
   - Implement efficient re-rendering strategies
   - Add memoization for expensive operations
   - Optimize event handling and subscriptions

## Files to Create/Modify
- Create `/src/state/TranscriptionStateManager.ts` - Unified state management
- `/src/contexts/StreamingTextContext.tsx` - Simplify and focus on streaming
- `/src/contexts/MultiWindowContext.tsx` - Remove transcription-specific logic
- `/src/hooks/useTranscriptionState.ts` - New unified hook

## State Architecture
```typescript
interface TranscriptionState {
  streaming: {
    current: StreamingTranscription | null
    isActive: boolean
    progress: number
  }
  static: {
    transcripts: TranscriptionResult[]
    isLoading: boolean
  }
  meta: {
    totalCount: number
    lastUpdate: number
  }
}
```

## Success Criteria
- Single source of truth for all transcription state
- Clear separation between streaming and static content
- Improved performance with reduced re-renders
- Proper memory management and cleanup

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Current State Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze existing state management patterns to identify overlaps and conflicts
### Details:
Examine current contexts, hooks, and state managers to understand the architecture and identify consolidation opportunities.

## 2. Create Unified TranscriptionStateManager [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create unified TranscriptionStateManager class as single source of truth
### Details:
Design and implement a unified state manager that consolidates all transcription-related state management into a single, efficient system with clear separation between streaming and static content.

## 3. Test and Integrate Unified State System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test the unified TranscriptionStateManager and hooks, then integrate with existing components
### Details:
Create comprehensive tests for the unified state system and integrate it with existing components to replace the overlapping state management systems.
