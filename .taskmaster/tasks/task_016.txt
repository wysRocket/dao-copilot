# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement WebSocket Connection Lifecycle Management and Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create robust connection management for the Gemini Live API WebSocket, including connection establishment, heartbeat monitoring, graceful disconnection, reconnection logic, and comprehensive error handling.
# Details:
1. Connection Establishment:
   a. Implement a connect() function that initializes the WebSocket connection to the Gemini Live API endpoint.
   b. Handle the 'open' event to confirm successful connection.
   c. Implement authentication if required by the API (e.g., sending API key in headers).

2. Heartbeat Monitoring:
   a. Set up a periodic heartbeat mechanism (e.g., every 30 seconds) to keep the connection alive.
   b. Implement a ping() function that sends a heartbeat message to the server.
   c. Create a pongReceived() function to handle server responses to heartbeats.
   d. Set up a timer to detect missed pongs and trigger reconnection if necessary.

3. Graceful Disconnection:
   a. Implement a disconnect() function that closes the WebSocket connection cleanly.
   b. Handle the 'close' event to perform any necessary cleanup.
   c. Ensure all resources are properly released on disconnection.

4. Reconnection Logic:
   a. Implement an exponential backoff algorithm for reconnection attempts.
   b. Create a reconnect() function that attempts to re-establish the connection.
   c. Set a maximum number of reconnection attempts before failing permanently.
   d. Implement a callback system to notify the application of reconnection status.

5. Error Handling:
   a. Create a comprehensive error handling system for various WebSocket and API errors.
   b. Implement specific error handlers for common scenarios (e.g., authentication failures, network issues, API-specific errors).
   c. Log errors with appropriate severity levels for debugging and monitoring.
   d. Implement a retry mechanism for transient errors.

6. State Management:
   a. Create an enumeration for connection states (e.g., CONNECTING, CONNECTED, DISCONNECTED, RECONNECTING).
   b. Implement a state machine to manage transitions between these states.
   c. Provide methods to query the current connection state.

7. Event System:
   a. Implement an event emitter to allow other parts of the application to subscribe to connection lifecycle events.
   b. Emit events for connection state changes, errors, and successful/failed operations.

8. Configuration:
   a. Create a configuration object to store WebSocket-related settings (e.g., API endpoint, reconnection attempts, heartbeat interval).
   b. Implement methods to update these configurations dynamically.

9. Integration:
   a. Update the existing WebSocket client in Task 13 to use this new connection management system.
   b. Ensure all components using the WebSocket connection are updated to handle the new lifecycle events and error scenarios.

10. Documentation:
    a. Write comprehensive documentation for the connection management system, including usage examples and error handling guidelines.
    b. Update the project's technical documentation to reflect the new WebSocket lifecycle management implementation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   a. Write unit tests for each major function (connect, disconnect, reconnect, ping, etc.).
   b. Test the state machine transitions for accuracy.
   c. Verify error handling for various error scenarios using mocked errors.
   d. Test the exponential backoff algorithm for correctness.

2. Integration Testing:
   a. Set up a test environment with a mock Gemini Live API WebSocket server.
   b. Test the full connection lifecycle, including establishment, heartbeat, and disconnection.
   c. Simulate network interruptions and verify reconnection behavior.
   d. Verify that authentication and session management work correctly with the API.

3. Error Handling and Recovery Testing:
   a. Simulate various error conditions (e.g., connection timeout, server errors, authentication failures).
   b. Verify that the system responds appropriately to each error type.
   c. Test the retry mechanism for transient errors.
   d. Ensure that permanent failures are handled gracefully and reported correctly.

4. Performance Testing:
   a. Test the system under high load conditions (e.g., rapid connect/disconnect cycles).
   b. Measure and optimize memory usage during long-running connections.
   c. Verify that heartbeat mechanisms do not significantly impact system performance.

5. Concurrency Testing:
   a. Test multiple simultaneous WebSocket connections to ensure proper handling.
   b. Verify that connection management works correctly in a multi-threaded environment.

6. API Compliance Testing:
   a. Ensure that all interactions with the Gemini Live API conform to its specifications.
   b. Verify handling of API-specific error codes and messages.

7. Event System Testing:
   a. Test that all expected events are emitted at the correct times.
   b. Verify that event listeners receive the correct data and in the expected format.

8. Configuration Testing:
   a. Test that configuration changes are applied correctly and take effect as expected.
   b. Verify that invalid configurations are handled appropriately.

9. Logging and Monitoring:
   a. Verify that all important events and errors are logged correctly.
   b. Test integration with any monitoring systems or tools.

10. Cross-platform Testing:
    a. Ensure the connection management system works consistently across all supported platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
    b. Test on different versions of Electron and Node.js to ensure compatibility.

11. User Acceptance Testing:
    a. Conduct end-to-end testing of the application using the new WebSocket connection management.
    b. Verify that the user experience is smooth, with no noticeable disruptions during reconnections or error handling.

## 1. Implement WebSocket Connection Establishment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a module to handle the initial WebSocket connection setup
### Details:
Implement a function to establish a WebSocket connection, including handling of connection parameters, SSL/TLS setup if required, and initial handshake process.

## Current Implementation Analysis:
- Existing `GeminiLiveWebSocketClient` has basic connection establishment via `connect()` method
