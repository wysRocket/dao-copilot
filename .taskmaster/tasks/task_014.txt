# Code Analysis Findings

## Main Transcription Service
- **main-stt-transcription.ts** implements batch processing via HTTP-based Gemini API
- Uses `transcribeAudio()` function accepting Buffer input
- Leverages GoogleGenAI SDK for content generation
- Supports multiple environment variable patterns for API keys
- Returns `TranscriptionResult` with text and duration metrics
- Processes audio as base64-encoded WAV files

## Fallback Proxy Service
- **proxy-stt-transcription.ts** provides HTTP-based proxy fallback
- Implements `transcribeAudioViaProxy()` function
- Uses fetch API to call proxy server endpoint
- Maintains consistent audio format and response structure
- Includes proxy authentication token handling

## Integration Opportunities
- Both services share similar interfaces that can be unified
- Existing `GeminiLiveIntegrationService` provides necessary WebSocket bridging
- Can reuse current audio format conversion utilities
- Environment variable handling patterns are consistent across services

## Recommended Migration Strategy
- Update both services to use `GeminiLiveIntegrationService` as primary interface
- Maintain existing function signatures for backward compatibility
- Implement mode switching (WebSocket, Batch, Hybrid)
- Add feature flags for gradual rollout

## 2. Design WebSocket integration [completed]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create a detailed design for integrating WebSocket functionality into the existing services
### Details:
Outline the WebSocket connection handling, message formats, and how it will interact with the current HTTP-based system
<info added on 2025-06-18T09:33:31.138Z>
## WebSocket Integration Design

### 1. Unified Transcription Interface
- Create `UnifiedTranscriptionService` that wraps both HTTP and WebSocket modes
- Maintain existing function signatures: `transcribeAudio(buffer, options)`
- Add mode selection via options: `{mode: 'websocket' | 'batch' | 'hybrid'}`

### 2. Service Layer Integration
- `main-stt-transcription.ts` becomes a wrapper around `GeminiLiveIntegrationService`
- `proxy-stt-transcription.ts` enhanced to support WebSocket proxy endpoints
- Automatic mode detection based on audio characteristics and connection quality

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- All existing function signatures preserved
- Default mode is 'hybrid' for seamless transition
- Feature flags: `GEMINI_WEBSOCKET_ENABLED`, `GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODE`
- Gradual rollout support with percentage-based enablement

### 4. Data Flow Design
```
Audio Buffer → Format Detection → Mode Selection → Integration Service
                                      ↓
WebSocket Mode: Real-time streaming ← GeminiLiveWebSocketClient
Batch Mode: HTTP processing ← Original GoogleGenAI SDK
Hybrid Mode: Smart switching based on audio length/quality
```

### 5. Error Handling & Fallback
- WebSocket failures automatically fallback to batch mode
- Network quality monitoring influences mode selection
- Comprehensive error classification and user feedback
