# Task ID: 27
# Title: Debug and Fix WebSocket Connection Issues for Gemini Live API Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 16, 20, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Identify and resolve outstanding issues with the WebSocket connection to Gemini Live API, focusing on connection stability, session management, error handling, and performance optimization to ensure reliable real-time transcription in production.
# Details:
1. Diagnostic Investigation:
   a. Implement comprehensive logging for WebSocket events and message flow
   b. Add instrumentation to track connection lifecycle events
   c. Create a connection status dashboard for real-time monitoring
   d. Analyze logs from production environment to identify patterns in connection failures

2. Connection Stability Improvements:
   a. Review and enhance the reconnection logic with proper exponential backoff
   b. Implement connection health checks with periodic ping/pong messages
   c. Add proper handling for network transitions (offline/online events)
   d. Implement graceful degradation when connection quality is poor

3. Session Management Enhancements:
   a. Fix session resumption implementation to properly maintain context
   b. Implement session timeout handling with user notifications
   c. Add proper cleanup of resources when sessions end
   d. Ensure session state is properly synchronized between client and server

4. Error Handling Improvements:
   a. Implement comprehensive error classification system:
      ```typescript
      enum WebSocketErrorType {
        CONNECTION_FAILED,
        CONNECTION_CLOSED,
        MESSAGE_FAILED,
        AUTHENTICATION_ERROR,
        SERVER_ERROR,
        TIMEOUT_ERROR,
        UNKNOWN_ERROR
      }
      
      interface WebSocketError {
        type: WebSocketErrorType;
        message: string;
        timestamp: number;
        retryable: boolean;
        context?: any;
      }
      ```
   b. Create specialized error handlers for each error type
   c. Implement user-friendly error messages and recovery suggestions
   d. Add automatic retry logic for transient errors

5. Performance Optimization:
   a. Analyze and optimize message payload size
   b. Implement message batching for high-frequency updates
   c. Optimize audio data compression before transmission
   d. Implement efficient binary message handling where appropriate
   e. Add performance metrics collection for monitoring

6. WebSocket Client Refactoring:
   a. Refactor the WebSocket client to use a state machine architecture:
      ```typescript
      enum ConnectionState {
        DISCONNECTED,
        CONNECTING,
        CONNECTED,
        RECONNECTING,
        CLOSING,
        ERROR
      }
      ```
   b. Implement proper state transitions with validation
   c. Add event emitters for state changes
   d. Ensure thread safety for concurrent operations

7. Testing and Validation:
   a. Create a test harness that simulates various network conditions
   b. Implement stress tests for connection stability
   c. Test session resumption under various failure scenarios
   d. Validate error recovery mechanisms

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   a. Create unit tests for all WebSocket client functions:
      - Connection establishment and authentication
      - Message handling and formatting
      - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
      - State machine transitions
   b. Test reconnection logic with mocked network failures
   c. Validate session management with simulated server responses

2. Integration Testing:
   a. Test end-to-end communication with the actual Gemini Live API
   b. Verify correct handling of all API response types
   c. Test with various audio inputs and verify transcription accuracy
   d. Validate session resumption with the live API

3. Performance Testing:
   a. Measure connection establishment time under various network conditions
   b. Test message throughput and latency
   c. Measure CPU and memory usage during extended sessions
   d. Test with simulated high-latency and low-bandwidth connections

4. Reliability Testing:
   a. Run extended sessions (8+ hours) to identify memory leaks or degradation
   b. Test automatic recovery from network interruptions
   c. Simulate server-side errors and verify client recovery
   d. Test with intermittent connectivity

5. Production Validation:
   a. Implement feature flags to gradually roll out fixes
   b. Add enhanced logging for the initial deployment
   c. Monitor error rates and connection stability metrics
   d. Collect user feedback on transcription reliability
   e. Compare performance metrics before and after implementation
