7. Make final adjustments to glass effects, animations, and layout as needed
8. Verify proper functioning of BackgroundEffect and DepthLayer components

# Test Strategy:
1. Create and execute a comprehensive test plan covering all application features
2. Conduct end-to-end testing of critical user flows
3. Test on multiple platforms and screen sizes
4. Perform regression testing to ensure no existing functionality is broken
5. Conduct user acceptance testing with a group of beta testers
6. Specifically test theme switching and synchronization between windows

# Subtasks:
## 1. Comprehensive Application Flow Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test the entire application flow with the restored glass UI, ensuring all features work as expected.
### Details:
Systematically test each feature and user flow in the application, paying special attention to the integration with the restored glass UI components. Verify both Main and Assistant windows are functioning properly. Document any inconsistencies or issues encountered.

## 2. IPC Communication Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Verify that all IPC communication is preserved and functioning correctly in the updated application, especially for theme synchronization.
### Details:
Review and test all instances of IPC communication between the main process and renderer processes. Ensure that data is being passed correctly and that all expected interactions are working. Pay special attention to theme switching and synchronization between windows.

## 3. Multi-window Functionality Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Test multi-window functionality in the Electron environment with the restored UI implementation.
### Details:
Test scenarios involving both Main window (window-id=main-1750171619047) and Assistant window (window-id=assistant-1750171638308). Verify proper window creation, communication between windows, and state management across windows.

## 4. Cross-platform Compatibility Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Conduct thorough testing on Windows, macOS, and Linux to ensure consistent functionality and appearance.
### Details:
Set up testing environments for each supported platform. Run through the full test suite on each platform, noting any platform-specific issues or inconsistencies. Verify that the CSS-based glass effects render properly across all platforms.

## 5. UI Polish and Final Adjustments [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Make final adjustments to glass effects, animations, layout, and overall styling to ensure a polished user interface.
### Details:
Review the application on all platforms, making necessary adjustments to ensure consistent styling, smooth animations, and proper implementation of glass effects. Verify that BackgroundEffect.tsx and DepthLayer.tsx components are working as expected. Test all glass variants (light, medium, heavy) to ensure proper styling.

## 6. Performance Optimization and Final Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.5
### Description: Optimize application performance and conduct a final round of validation testing.
### Details:
Profile the application to identify and address any performance bottlenecks. Conduct a final round of testing to ensure all adjustments have not introduced new issues and that the application meets all requirements. Verify that the CSS-based glassmorphism implementation performs well across different devices.

## 7. Theme System Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Verify that the theme system is working correctly across the application.
### Details:
Test theme switching functionality and verify that CSS variables are properly applied for both light and dark themes. Ensure that theme changes are properly synchronized between Main and Assistant windows through IPC communication.

## 8. Glass Components Verification [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Verify that all glass components are displaying correctly with the CSS-based implementation.
### Details:
Test GlassBox components with all variants (light, medium, heavy) to ensure proper styling. Verify that BackgroundEffect and DepthLayer components are working as expected for proper z-index layering and glassmorphism effects.

## 9. Optimize Assistant Window Color Palette and Gradients [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve color palette, gradients, and glass effect opacity in the Assistant window for better glassmorphism appearance and readability.
### Details:
- Enhanced background gradients with better contrast and depth
- Increased glass effect opacity from 0.08/0.12/0.16 to 0.12/0.18/0.25
- Improved glass border opacity from 0.1 to 0.15/0.18
- Added gradient overlays with blue, purple, and green accent colors
- Enhanced header and footer styling with better shadows and inset highlights
