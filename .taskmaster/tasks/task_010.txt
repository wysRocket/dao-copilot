# Task ID: 10
# Title: Optimize Glass Rendering Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure that the glassmorphism effects do not negatively impact the application's performance.
# Details:
1. Implement React.memo for glass components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. Use CSS containment properties to optimize rendering
3. Implement virtualization for long lists (e.g., in TranscriptDisplay)
4. Optimize blur effects using CSS backdrop-filter where possible
5. Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
6. Implement lazy loading for off-screen components
7. Profile and optimize JavaScript execution

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct performance profiling using Chrome DevTools
2. Measure and compare FPS before and after optimization
3. Test scrolling performance in long lists
4. Verify smooth animations across the application
5. Conduct performance tests on lower-end devices to ensure acceptable performance
