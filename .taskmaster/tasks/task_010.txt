# Task ID: 10
# Title: Optimize Glass Rendering Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure that the glassmorphism effects do not negatively impact the application's performance.
# Details:
1. Implement React.memo for glass components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. Use CSS containment properties to optimize rendering
3. Implement virtualization for long lists (e.g., in TranscriptDisplay)
4. Optimize blur effects using CSS backdrop-filter where possible
5. Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
6. Implement lazy loading for off-screen components
7. Profile and optimize JavaScript execution
8. Ensure consistent performance across all pages with glassmorphism (SettingsPage, ChatPage, TranscriptsPage, AnalysisPage)

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct performance profiling using Chrome DevTools
2. Measure and compare FPS before and after optimization
3. Test scrolling performance in long lists
4. Verify smooth animations across the application
5. Conduct performance tests on lower-end devices to ensure acceptable performance
6. Test performance across all pages with glassmorphism styling

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Component Memoization and Virtualization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply React.memo to glass components and implement virtualization for long lists to prevent unnecessary re-renders and optimize rendering of large data sets.
### Details:
1. Identify all glass UI components that could benefit from memoization
2. Apply React.memo with custom comparison functions where needed
3. Implement react-window or react-virtualized for the TranscriptDisplay component
4. Create a custom hook for virtualization that works with glass components
5. Test rendering performance before and after implementation

## 2. Optimize CSS for Glass Effects [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement CSS containment properties and optimize blur effects using backdrop-filter to improve rendering performance of glass components.
### Details:
1. Add 'contain: content' or 'contain: layout' to glass components where appropriate
2. Replace JavaScript-based blur effects with CSS backdrop-filter
3. Use will-change property judiciously for glass elements that animate
4. Implement hardware acceleration via transform: translateZ(0) for glass panels
5. Create a performance-optimized CSS class system for glass effects

## 3. Implement Animation Optimizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations and optimize transitions for glass components to reduce jank and improve perceived performance.
### Details:
1. Replace setTimeout/setInterval with requestAnimationFrame for all animations
2. Create a utility function for optimized animations on glass components
3. Implement FLIP (First, Last, Invert, Play) technique for layout animations
4. Use CSS transforms instead of position/size properties for animations
5. Batch animation updates to minimize layout thrashing
6. Focus on optimizing animations across all pages with glassmorphism (SettingsPage, ChatPage, TranscriptsPage, AnalysisPage)

## 4. Implement Memory Management for Glass Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Optimize memory usage by implementing lazy loading for off-screen components and proper cleanup of resources to prevent memory leaks.
### Details:
1. Implement React.lazy and Suspense for code-splitting glass components
2. Create an IntersectionObserver utility to lazy load off-screen glass elements
3. Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks for all glass components
4. Add a memory management system to dispose of unused resources
5. Optimize image assets used in glass components with proper sizing and formats
6. Ensure ThemeToggle component efficiently handles theme synchronization across windows without memory leaks

## 5. Implement Performance Monitoring System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Create a performance monitoring system to track and analyze the performance of glass components in production.
### Details:
1. Implement custom performance marks and measures using the Performance API
2. Create a dashboard to visualize performance metrics for glass components
3. Set up automated performance regression testing
4. Implement user-centric performance metrics (FCP, LCP, CLS) for glass UI
5. Create a feedback mechanism to collect performance data from production
6. Include specific metrics for each page type (SettingsPage, ChatPage, TranscriptsPage, AnalysisPage)

## 6. Optimize Page-Specific Glass Effects [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Optimize the glassmorphism effects on each specific page to ensure consistent performance across the application.
### Details:
1. Profile and optimize SettingsPage glassmorphism backgrounds for all settings sections
2. Optimize ChatPage glassmorphism container while preserving existing styling
3. Optimize TranscriptsPage glassmorphism background with focus on list rendering performance
4. Optimize AnalysisPage glassmorphism background with focus on data visualization performance
5. Implement shared optimization techniques across all pages to maintain consistency
