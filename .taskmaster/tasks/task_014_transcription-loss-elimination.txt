# Task ID: 14
# Title: Develop Audio Alignment and Completeness Verification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system to verify transcription completeness by aligning with the original audio.
# Details:
Implement an AudioAlignmentVerifier class that uses audio fingerprinting or other heuristics to align transcription with original audio. Create a completeness calculation algorithm that can estimate what percentage of verbal content was successfully transcribed. Implement a verification process that can be run both in real-time and as a post-processing step. Add telemetry for completeness metrics to track system performance against the 99.95% target. Create visualization tools for debugging alignment issues.

# Test Strategy:
Test alignment algorithm with known audio samples and transcripts. Create a test suite with intentionally incomplete transcriptions to verify detection accuracy. Benchmark alignment performance to ensure it doesn't add significant overhead. Test with various audio qualities, accents, and speaking styles to verify robustness. Create integration tests that verify end-to-end completeness measurement.
