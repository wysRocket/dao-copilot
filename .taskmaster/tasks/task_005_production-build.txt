# Task ID: 5
# Title: Distribution and Deployment Strategy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Plan and implement distribution strategy including code signing, notarization for macOS, creating installation packages, setting up auto-updater, and preparing for app store distributions.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a comprehensive distribution and deployment strategy:

1. Code Signing Setup:
   - Obtain code signing certificates for each target platform (Apple Developer Certificate, Microsoft Authenticode)
   - Configure automated code signing in the build pipeline
   - Implement secure certificate storage and access in CI/CD systems
   - Document certificate renewal procedures and emergency revocation process

2. macOS Notarization:
   - Implement Apple notarization process for macOS builds
   - Configure entitlements for the application
   - Set up hardened runtime requirements
   - Automate the notarization submission and verification process
   - Handle notarization failures and implement retry mechanisms

3. Installation Package Creation:
   - Create platform-specific installers (DMG/PKG for macOS, MSI/EXE for Windows, DEB/RPM for Linux)
   - Configure custom installation paths and requirements
   - Include necessary dependencies and runtime components
   - Design and implement custom installation screens if needed
   - Add license agreements and terms of service to installers

4. Auto-Update Implementation:
   - Integrate Electron's autoUpdater module or alternative solutions
   - Set up update server infrastructure or use existing services (e.g., GitHub Releases)
   - Implement update checking logic with appropriate frequency
   - Create update notification UI with download progress and installation options
   - Handle update failures gracefully with proper error reporting

5. App Store Distribution Preparation:
   - Prepare application metadata, screenshots, and marketing materials
   - Configure app store specific requirements (sandboxing for Mac App Store)
   - Implement in-app purchase capabilities if needed
   - Address app review guidelines and potential rejection issues
   - Create app store listing drafts and submission packages

6. Direct Distribution Channel:
   - Set up website download infrastructure with proper CDN integration
   - Implement download analytics and tracking
   - Create secure download links with integrity verification
   - Design and implement a version management system for direct downloads
   - Configure geographic distribution optimization if needed

# Test Strategy:
1. Code Signing Verification:
   - Verify digital signatures on all built artifacts using platform-specific tools
   - Test installation on systems with strict security policies enabled
   - Confirm certificate chain validity and expiration dates
   - Validate code signing across different build environments (local, CI/CD)

2. Notarization Testing:
   - Verify successful notarization with Apple's tools (spctl, stapler)
   - Test installation on macOS with Gatekeeper enabled at strictest settings
   - Validate that notarized apps launch without security warnings
   - Test the application after system updates to ensure continued compliance

3. Installer Testing:
   - Test installation on clean systems for each target platform
   - Verify proper installation of all components and dependencies
   - Test upgrade scenarios from previous versions
   - Validate uninstallation process and complete removal of application files
   - Test installation with minimal user permissions

4. Auto-Update Testing:
   - Verify update detection for different version scenarios (minor, major updates)
   - Test update download and installation process
   - Validate application state preservation after updates
   - Test update failures and recovery mechanisms
   - Verify update notifications and user interaction flows

5. App Store Submission Testing:
   - Perform pre-submission validation using store validation tools
   - Test app functionality within store sandbox environments
   - Verify in-app purchases and store-specific features
   - Validate app behavior after store updates
   - Test app installation from store test environments

6. Distribution Channel Testing:
   - Verify download links and CDN distribution
   - Test download resume capabilities and integrity checks
   - Validate analytics tracking for downloads
   - Test geographic distribution and download speeds from various locations
   - Verify proper versioning and update paths for direct downloads
