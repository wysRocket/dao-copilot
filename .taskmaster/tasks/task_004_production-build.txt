# Task ID: 4
# Title: Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive testing of production builds including functionality testing, performance benchmarking, security testing, and cross-platform compatibility verification across all major features.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a thorough testing strategy for the production builds:

1. Functional Testing:
   - Test WebSocket connections for stability and reconnection capabilities
   - Verify audio capture functionality across different input devices
   - Validate transcription services integration and accuracy
   - Test all user interface interactions and workflows
   - Verify data persistence and state management
   - Test error handling and recovery mechanisms

2. Performance Benchmarking:
   - Measure application startup time across platforms
   - Profile memory usage during extended usage sessions
   - Benchmark CPU utilization during intensive operations
   - Test network bandwidth consumption during WebSocket operations
   - Measure transcription processing latency
   - Evaluate UI responsiveness under load

3. Security Testing:
   - Verify secure storage of user credentials and sensitive data
   - Test authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Validate input sanitization and protection against injection attacks
   - Check for proper implementation of HTTPS/WSS protocols
   - Verify secure handling of API keys and tokens
   - Test for potential data leakage in logs or error messages

4. Cross-Platform Compatibility:
   - Test on all target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Verify consistent behavior across different OS versions
   - Test with various hardware configurations
   - Validate proper handling of platform-specific features
   - Check for UI consistency across platforms
   - Verify installation and update processes on each platform

5. Regression Testing:
   - Create automated test suites for critical functionality
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline integration for automated testing
   - Document test cases for manual verification
   - Establish baseline performance metrics for future comparison

# Test Strategy:
1. Automated Testing:
   - Implement and run end-to-end tests using Playwright or Spectron
   - Create unit tests for critical components and services
   - Set up integration tests for WebSocket connections and transcription services
   - Configure performance testing scripts to measure key metrics
   - Implement security scanning in the testing pipeline

2. Manual Testing:
   - Create a test matrix covering all platforms and major features
   - Perform exploratory testing to identify edge cases
   - Conduct usability testing with representative users
   - Test with various audio input devices and configurations
   - Verify proper handling of network interruptions and recovery

3. Documentation and Reporting:
   - Document all test results in a standardized format
   - Create performance benchmarking reports with baseline comparisons
   - Generate security testing reports highlighting any vulnerabilities
   - Produce compatibility matrices showing test results across platforms
   - Document any identified bugs with reproduction steps

4. Acceptance Criteria:
   - All critical functionality works correctly across all platforms
   - Performance metrics meet or exceed defined baselines
   - No high or critical security vulnerabilities are present
   - UI is consistent and responsive across all supported platforms
   - Error handling gracefully manages all tested edge cases
