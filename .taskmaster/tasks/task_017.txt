# Task ID: 17
# Title: Update UI Components for Real-Time WebSocket Transcription
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14, 15, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the TranscriptDisplay component and related UI elements to handle real-time streaming transcription results from the WebSocket connection, including partial results, streaming animations, and improved real-time user feedback.
# Details:
1. Modify TranscriptDisplay component:
   a. Implement a streaming text animation for partial results
   b. Add visual indicators for active transcription (e.g., pulsing animation)
   c. Create smooth transitions between partial and final transcription results
   d. Implement proper handling of transcription corrections and updates

2. Update transcript history display:
   a. Modify the transcript history component to properly distinguish between final and in-progress transcriptions
   b. Implement proper scrolling behavior to follow new content while maintaining readability
   c. Add visual differentiation between user queries and AI responses

3. Implement real-time feedback indicators:
   a. Add a "listening" indicator that shows when audio is being processed
   b. Create a "processing" indicator for when transcription is being generated
   c. Implement subtle animations that indicate data is flowing through the WebSocket

4. Optimize rendering performance:
   a. Use React.memo or useMemo for components that don't need frequent re-renders
   b. Implement virtualized lists for long transcription histories
   c. Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations

5. Handle edge cases:
   a. Implement graceful handling of connection interruptions
   b. Add visual feedback for error states
   c. Create fallback UI states for when real-time transcription is unavailable
   d. Handle rapid updates without UI flickering

6. Ensure accessibility:
   a. Maintain proper ARIA attributes for screen readers
   b. Ensure animations respect reduced motion preferences
   c. Provide text alternatives for visual indicators

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   a. Write tests for the TranscriptDisplay component to verify it correctly renders streaming text
   b. Test the animation components in isolation to ensure they behave as expected
   c. Verify that the component correctly handles different states (idle, listening, processing, error)
   d. Test edge cases like empty transcriptions, very long transcriptions, and rapid updates

2. Integration Testing:
   a. Test the integration between the WebSocket client and UI components
   b. Verify that real-time updates from the WebSocket are correctly displayed in the UI
   c. Test the complete flow from audio capture to transcription display
   d. Ensure that the UI remains responsive during continuous streaming

3. Performance Testing:
   a. Measure and optimize render times for streaming updates
   b. Test with large transcription histories to ensure the UI remains responsive
   c. Verify smooth animations even during high update frequency
   d. Test on lower-end devices to ensure acceptable performance

4. User Experience Testing:
   a. Conduct usability tests to ensure the real-time feedback is intuitive
   b. Verify that users can easily distinguish between partial and final results
   c. Test with actual speech input to ensure the experience feels natural
   d. Gather feedback on the visual indicators and animations

5. Accessibility Testing:
   a. Test with screen readers to ensure all updates are properly announced
   b. Verify that the UI is navigable using keyboard only
   c. Test with animation/motion disabled to ensure functionality is preserved

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement TranscriptDisplay modifications [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the TranscriptDisplay component to handle real-time streaming of transcription results
### Details:
Modify the existing TranscriptDisplay component to efficiently render and update transcription text as it streams in. Implement a scrolling mechanism to keep the latest text visible.

## 2. Create streaming animations [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Develop smooth animations to visually represent the incoming stream of transcription data
### Details:
Design and implement animations that provide visual feedback for incoming transcription data. This may include typing effects, fading in new text, or other subtle animations to enhance user experience.

## 3. Implement real-time feedback indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Add visual indicators to show the current status of transcription and audio processing
### Details:
Create and integrate UI elements such as progress bars, status icons, or animated indicators to show when audio is being processed, transcription is in progress, or when the system is waiting for input.

## 4. Develop partial result handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2
### Description: Implement logic to process and display partial transcription results as they become available
### Details:
Create a system to handle partial transcription results, including temporary display of incomplete sentences, word-level updates, and smooth transitions as results are finalized.

## 5. Optimize performance for continuous updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Implement performance optimizations to ensure smooth UI updates during continuous transcription
### Details:
Analyze and optimize rendering performance, implement efficient state management, and use techniques like debouncing or throttling to handle high-frequency updates without compromising UI responsiveness.
