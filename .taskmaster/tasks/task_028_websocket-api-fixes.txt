# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement Real Microphone Audio Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 27, 25, 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a proper testing mechanism using actual voice input from microphones instead of synthetic 32ms test chunks to validate transcription functionality in real-world conditions.
# Details:
1. Audio Capture Implementation:
   - Create a MicrophoneAudioTester class that can access and record from system microphones
   - Implement proper audio device selection with fallback options
   - Add configurable recording parameters (sample rate, bit depth, channels)
   - Ensure compatibility with browser audio APIs for web testing

2. Test Data Management:
   - Develop a system to record, store, and replay real microphone audio samples
   - Create a library of standardized test phrases in multiple languages and accents
   - Implement metadata tagging for test audio (speaker demographics, environment conditions)
   - Build a versioned repository of test audio files for regression testing

3. Integration with Transcription Pipeline:
   - Modify the existing audio processing pipeline to accept real microphone input
   - Create adapters to ensure compatibility with the current 32ms chunk processing
   - Implement a toggle mechanism to switch between synthetic and real audio testing
   - Add instrumentation to measure and compare performance between synthetic and real audio

4. Environment Simulation:
   - Implement background noise simulation at various levels (quiet, moderate, loud)
   - Create test scenarios for different acoustic environments (echo, reverb, etc.)
   - Add variable distance testing (close mic, medium distance, far field)
   - Develop multi-speaker overlapping audio test cases

5. Automated Testing Framework:
   - Build a CI/CD compatible testing framework for microphone audio
   - Implement automated comparison between expected transcription and actual results
   - Create detailed reporting on Word Error Rate (WER) and other accuracy metrics
   - Add performance benchmarking for processing time and resource usage

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test MicrophoneAudioTester class with mock audio devices
   - Verify proper audio format conversion and processing
   - Test error handling for missing or malfunctioning microphones
   - Validate test data management functions

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify end-to-end flow from microphone capture to transcription output
   - Test with various microphone types (built-in, external USB, headset)
   - Compare transcription accuracy between synthetic and real audio inputs
   - Measure performance impact of real audio processing vs. synthetic chunks

3. Accuracy Testing:
   - Create a benchmark suite with known phrases in multiple languages
   - Measure Word Error Rate (WER) across different speakers and accents
   - Test transcription accuracy in various noise conditions
   - Compare results against baseline performance with synthetic audio

4. Stress Testing:
   - Test with continuous long-form speech (5+ minutes)
   - Measure performance degradation over extended usage
   - Test with rapid speaker changes and interruptions
   - Verify system stability with poor quality audio inputs

5. Regression Testing:
   - Implement automated regression tests using the recorded audio library
   - Compare transcription results across software versions
   - Verify that fixes for specific audio scenarios remain effective
   - Maintain a performance benchmark history to track improvements or regressions
