# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Deduplication and Merge Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a sophisticated deduplication and merge engine to handle overlapping, duplicate, or conflicting transcript segments.
# Details:
Develop a TranscriptMergeEngine class that maintains a rolling content hash plus time bucket for each partial sequence. Implement logic to handle content regression (shorter content arriving after longer content) by treating it as a revision and keeping the longest unless confidence dictates replacement. Create a merge algorithm that chooses the most confident consistent growth path when reconciling multiple versions of the same transcript. Implement conflict resolution strategies based on confidence scores, timing, and content consistency. Add telemetry for merge decisions to enable analysis and tuning of the algorithm.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test the hashing mechanism to verify it correctly identifies duplicate content. Test the merge algorithm with various scenarios of overlapping, conflicting, and regressing content. Create integration tests with real-world examples of problematic merges. Benchmark the merge engine performance to ensure it meets latency requirements. Test edge cases like very short segments, identical confidence scores, and near-simultaneous arrivals.
