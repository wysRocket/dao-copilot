# Task ID: 14
# Title: Fix localStorage Access Error in TranscriptionStateManager
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 11, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement environment detection and fallback storage mechanism in TranscriptionStateManager to resolve 'localStorage is not defined' errors occurring in Electron's main process.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current TranscriptionStateManager implementation to identify all localStorage access points:
   - Map all read/write operations that use localStorage
   - Determine which components are affected by this error
   - Identify the execution context where the error occurs (Electron main process)

2. Design and implement an environment detection mechanism:
   - Create a utility function `isRendererProcess()` that checks if the code is running in a browser/renderer context
   - Add detection for Electron's main process vs renderer process
   - Implement Node.js environment detection for server-side contexts

3. Create a storage abstraction layer:
   - Develop a `StorageProvider` interface with standard methods (get, set, remove, clear)
   - Implement `LocalStorageProvider` for browser/renderer contexts
   - Implement `NodeStorageProvider` for Electron main process using Node.js filesystem (fs) module
     - Use electron-store or a similar library for persistent storage in main process
     - Ensure file-based storage uses proper error handling and atomic writes

4. Modify TranscriptionStateManager to use the new storage abstraction:
   - Replace direct localStorage calls with the abstraction layer
   - Implement automatic provider selection based on environment detection
   - Add graceful fallbacks if neither storage option is available (in-memory storage)
   - Ensure data consistency between different storage mechanisms

5. Add migration logic for existing data:
   - Implement data migration from localStorage to the new storage system
   - Handle edge cases where data might exist in multiple storage locations

6. Update related components:
   - Modify any components that directly interact with TranscriptionStateManager
   - Update documentation to reflect the new storage architecture

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for the environment detection utility
   - Test each storage provider implementation independently
   - Verify the TranscriptionStateManager works with each storage provider
   - Test edge cases like storage quota exceeded, corrupted data, etc.

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the TranscriptionStateManager in both Electron main and renderer processes
   - Verify data persistence across application restarts
   - Test migration of existing data from localStorage to new storage
   - Ensure consistent behavior regardless of execution context

3. Electron-specific Testing:
   - Create test scenarios that simulate the Electron main process environment
   - Verify the fallback mechanism activates correctly when localStorage is unavailable
   - Test inter-process communication if data needs to be shared between main and renderer

4. Error Handling Testing:
   - Simulate storage access failures to verify error handling
   - Test recovery mechanisms when primary storage is unavailable
   - Verify appropriate error messages are logged for debugging

5. Performance Testing:
   - Compare performance metrics between localStorage and the fallback mechanism
   - Ensure the storage abstraction doesn't introduce significant overhead
   - Test with various data sizes to verify scalability

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze TranscriptionStateManager and Identify localStorage Access Points [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform a thorough analysis of the current TranscriptionStateManager implementation to identify all localStorage access points and understand the execution context where errors occur.
### Details:
1. Review the TranscriptionStateManager source code to locate all instances of localStorage usage
2. Document each read operation (getItem) and write operation (setItem, removeItem, clear)
3. Create a map of all components that interact with TranscriptionStateManager
4. Identify specific execution paths that trigger the 'localStorage is not defined' error in Electron's main process
5. Determine the data structure and format being stored in localStorage
6. Document the current error handling (if any) around localStorage operations

## 2. Create Environment Detection Utility [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Design and implement a utility function that can detect the current execution environment to determine the appropriate storage mechanism to use.
### Details:
1. Create a new utility file `environmentDetector.js` with the following functions:
   - `isRendererProcess()`: Checks if code is running in browser/renderer context
   - `isElectronMainProcess()`: Detects Electron's main process
   - `isNodeEnvironment()`: Identifies Node.js server-side context
   - `getEnvironmentType()`: Returns an enum value representing the current environment
2. Implement detection logic using environment-specific globals:
   - Check for `window` and `document` objects for browser/renderer detection
   - Use `process.type` to identify Electron processes
   - Check for Node.js specific globals
3. Add comprehensive error handling to prevent exceptions during detection

4. Added temporary protection in TranscriptionStateManager by implementing 'typeof localStorage !== undefined' checks before each localStorage access point.

5. Tested the temporary solution in Electron main process and confirmed it prevents the immediate errors.

6. Document the current limitations of this approach:
   - It's a defensive check rather than a proper environment-aware solution
   - Still doesn't provide alternative storage for non-browser environments
   - Will be replaced by the storage provider abstraction in subtask 14.3

7. Create unit tests to verify the environment detection utility functions work correctly across different execution contexts.

8. Completed the environment detection utility as a TypeScript module:
   - Implemented all required detection functions with proper TypeScript typing
   - Added `isLocalStorageAvailable()` function to specifically check storage availability
   - Created `getRecommendedStorageType()` function that suggests appropriate storage mechanism based on environment

9. Enhanced the utility with comprehensive TypeScript support:
   - Added proper type definitions and interfaces
   - Created an Environment enum for consistent environment identification
   - Fixed all TypeScript lint errors and ensured type safety

10. Integrated the utility with TranscriptionStateManager:
    - Replaced temporary checks with calls to the new utility functions
    - Added conditional logic to prevent localStorage access in incompatible environments

11. Created unit tests for all utility functions:
    - Wrote tests for each detection function
    - Added mocking for different environment globals
    - Note: Experiencing some Vitest environment configuration issues, but tests verify core functionality

12. Ready for implementation of the storage provider abstraction layer in subtask 14.3.

## 3. Implement Storage Provider Abstraction Layer [done]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Create a storage abstraction layer with multiple provider implementations to handle different execution environments.
### Details:
1. Define a `StorageProvider` interface with standard methods:
   - `get(key: string): any`
   - `set(key: string, value: any): void`
   - `remove(key: string): void`
   - `clear(): void`
   - `has(key: string): boolean`
2. Implement `LocalStorageProvider` for browser/renderer contexts
3. Implement `NodeStorageProvider` for Electron main process using Node's fs module or electron-store
   - Ensure atomic writes using temporary files and rename operations
   - Implement proper error handling for file operations
   - Add file locking mechanism to prevent concurrent access issues
4. Create `InMemoryProvider` as a fallback option
5. Implement a `StorageProviderFactory` that returns the appropriate provider based on environment

## 4. Refactor TranscriptionStateManager to Use Storage Abstraction [done]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Modify the TranscriptionStateManager to use the new storage abstraction layer and implement data migration logic.
### Details:
1. Refactor TranscriptionStateManager to use the StorageProvider abstraction:
   - Initialize the appropriate provider via StorageProviderFactory
   - Replace all direct localStorage calls with provider method calls
   - Add error handling for storage operations
2. Implement data migration logic:
   - On initialization, check for existing data in localStorage
   - If found, migrate to the new storage system
   - Handle potential data format inconsistencies
3. Add configuration options for storage location preferences
4. Implement graceful degradation if preferred storage is unavailable
5. Update any components that directly interact with TranscriptionStateManager
6. Add logging for storage operations to aid debugging
