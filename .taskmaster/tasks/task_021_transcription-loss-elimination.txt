# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Deduplication and Merge Engine
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 16, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a sophisticated deduplication and merge engine that handles content hash comparison, confidence-based selection, and consistent growth path determination.
# Details:
Develop a deduplication and merge system that:
1. Implements rolling content hash + time bucket for each partial sequence
2. Handles content regression by treating shorter content as a revision
3. Implements logic to keep longest content unless confidence dictates replacement
4. Creates a merge algorithm that chooses the most confident consistent growth path
5. Handles edge cases like overlapping content and partial duplicates
6. Provides conflict resolution for competing transcripts
7. Maintains transcript integrity during merges

Code structure:
```typescript
interface MergeOptions {
  preferLongest: boolean;
  confidenceThreshold: number;
  timeToleranceMs: number;
}

class DeduplicationEngine {
  private contentHashes: Map<string, TranscriptSegment[]>;
  
  constructor(private options: MergeOptions) {...}
  
  generateHash(segment: TranscriptSegment): string {...}
  isDuplicate(segment: TranscriptSegment): boolean {...}
  handlePotentialDuplicate(segment: TranscriptSegment): TranscriptSegment {...}
}

class MergeEngine {
  constructor(private options: MergeOptions) {...}
  
  mergeSegments(segments: TranscriptSegment[]): TranscriptSegment {...}
  determineGrowthPath(segments: TranscriptSegment[]): TranscriptSegment[] {...}
  resolveConflict(a: TranscriptSegment, b: TranscriptSegment): TranscriptSegment {...}
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for hash generation and comparison
2. Test duplicate detection with various content similarities
3. Verify content regression handling
4. Test merge algorithm with different confidence levels
5. Verify consistent growth path determination
6. Test conflict resolution with competing transcripts
7. Integration tests with real-world transcript patterns
8. Performance testing with large volumes of similar transcripts
