# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Real-time Audio Capture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the existing audio recording service to support continuous real-time audio capture using Web Audio API.
# Details:
1. Use Web Audio API (latest spec) for audio capture.
2. Create an AudioCaptureService class.
3. Implement methods for starting and stopping audio capture.
4. Use AudioContext and MediaStreamAudioSourceNode for audio processing.
5. Set up a ScriptProcessorNode (or AudioWorklet for modern browsers) for real-time audio processing.
6. Configure audio capture for 16-bit PCM format at 16kHz sample rate, mono channel.
7. Implement audio buffering with 100ms chunk size.
8. Use TypeScript for type safety.
9. Optimize for low latency and CPU usage.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test AudioCaptureService methods.
2. Test audio format conversion accuracy.
3. Measure and assert on latency and CPU usage.
4. Test with various audio input devices.
5. Verify correct audio chunk size and format.
