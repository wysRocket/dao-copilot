# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Dark Theme Color Scheme
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create and apply a dark theme color scheme based on the Fumadocs dark theme aesthetics.
# Details:
1. Define a set of color variables in a new `theme.ts` file, using CSS custom properties
2. Colors should include: background (black/dark gray), text, accent colors
3. Implement a ThemeProvider component using React Context
4. Wrap the main application component with the ThemeProvider
5. Update global styles to use the new theme variables
6. Ensure all existing components use the new color scheme
7. Implement a theme toggle functionality (optional)

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that all components use the new color variables
2. Test the application in both light and dark modes (if toggle is implemented)
3. Ensure color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility
4. Conduct a visual inspection to confirm the Fumadocs-inspired dark theme is applied correctly

Updated multiple key components to use theme variables:

1. **PerformanceDashboard**: Replaced hard-coded colors (green-500, yellow-500, red-500, gray-400, blue-500) with theme-aware versions that adapt to dark/light themes
2. **ChatPage**: Updated user message bubbles to use bg-primary/text-primary-foreground, input fields to use proper border/background colors, and send button styling
3. **ToggleTheme**: Enhanced to show current theme state (sun/moon icons) and use theme context properly with mode detection
4. **ShortcutDebugger**: Replaced hard-coded gray colors with theme-aware card background and muted text colors
5. **AnalysisPage**: Updated confidence score colors to use theme-aware green variants
6. **SettingsPage**: Updated save button to use primary theme colors instead of hard-coded blue

All updated components now properly respond to dark/light theme switching and use the theme variables defined in the global CSS. The theme system is now consistently applied across the major UI components.

The toggle button has been successfully implemented with the following enhancements:

- **ToggleTheme Component**: Fully functional with sun/moon icons that change based on current theme mode, integrated into CustomTitleBar
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Added Ctrl+Shift+T shortcut for theme switching that works globally across all windows
- **ThemeStatus Component**: Created a new component to display current theme mode with icons and text for user awareness
- **Theme Persistence**: ThemeProvider handles localStorage persistence and system theme detection
- **TestGlassComponent**: Updated to showcase theme integration with glassmorphism effects that adapt to light/dark themes

The theme toggle system is complete with visual toggle button in the title bar, keyboard shortcut support, automatic system theme detection, persistent theme preference storage, glass effects that adapt to theme mode, and all UI components responding correctly to theme changes. Theme switching is smooth and immediate across all components.
