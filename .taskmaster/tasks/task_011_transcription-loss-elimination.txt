# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Session and ID Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance session management and ID handling to prevent orphaned partials and ensure consistent transcript identification.
# Details:
Create a SessionManager class that handles session lifecycle and ensures consistent ID assignment. Implement safeguards against session ID reuse or mismatch that could lead to orphaned partials. Add session boundary detection and handling to ensure clean transitions between sessions. Create a robust ID generation mechanism that guarantees uniqueness even in offline or disconnected scenarios. Implement session recovery for interrupted sessions to prevent data loss. Add telemetry for session events to track session health and identify problematic patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test session creation, termination, and ID generation. Test session boundary handling with rapid stop/start sequences. Create integration tests that simulate various session interruption scenarios and verify recovery. Test ID uniqueness under high concurrency. Verify telemetry correctly captures session lifecycle events.
