# Task ID: 27
# Title: Fix WebSocket Response Message Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25, 11, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the system correctly handles inputTranscription responses from serverContent and modelTurn messages, not just simple text type responses, to properly process all WebSocket message types.
# Details:
1. Message Type Analysis:
   - Review the Gemini Live API documentation to identify all possible message types (serverContent, modelTurn, inputTranscription, etc.)
   - Create a comprehensive mapping of message types to their expected structure and content
   - Document the specific format of inputTranscription responses within serverContent and modelTurn messages

2. Response Handler Implementation:
   - Refactor the existing WebSocket message handler to properly parse and process all message types
   - Implement specialized handlers for inputTranscription responses embedded within serverContent and modelTurn messages
   - Create a MessageTypeIdentifier class that can accurately determine the message type and structure before processing
   - Ensure proper extraction of transcription content regardless of the containing message type

3. Error Handling Improvements:
   - Implement robust error handling for malformed or unexpected message structures
   - Add detailed logging for message parsing failures to aid in debugging
   - Create fallback processing for partial or incomplete messages

4. State Management:
   - Implement proper state tracking to handle multi-part messages that may arrive across multiple WebSocket frames
   - Ensure the system can correlate related messages (e.g., matching inputTranscription with corresponding modelTurn)
   - Add safeguards against processing duplicate or out-of-order messages

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Optimize message parsing for efficiency, especially for high-frequency transcription updates
   - Implement message buffering if needed to handle bursts of incoming messages
   - Consider using worker threads for message processing to prevent UI blocking

6. Integration with Rendering:
   - Update the rendering pipeline to properly display transcription content from all message types
   - Ensure consistent formatting and presentation regardless of the source message type
   - Implement smooth transitions between different message types in the UI

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for each message type handler
   - Test with sample payloads representing all known message structures from the Gemini Live API
   - Implement tests for edge cases such as empty messages, partial messages, and malformed JSON
   - Verify correct extraction of inputTranscription data from different container message types

2. Integration Testing:
   - Set up integration tests that simulate the full WebSocket communication flow
   - Create mock server responses that include various combinations of message types
   - Test the end-to-end flow from receiving a WebSocket message to displaying the transcription
   - Verify correct handling of mixed message sequences (e.g., serverContent followed by modelTurn)

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure processing time for different message types and sizes
   - Test system behavior under high message volume scenarios
   - Verify that message processing doesn't block the UI thread

4. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure that existing functionality for simple text responses still works correctly
   - Verify that no regressions are introduced in the WebSocket connection handling
   - Test backward compatibility with older message formats if applicable

5. Manual Testing:
   - Create a test harness that allows manual testing of different message scenarios
   - Implement a message type simulator to generate various response patterns
   - Perform visual verification of transcription rendering for all message types

6. Logging Verification:
   - Review logs to ensure proper tracking of message processing
   - Verify that error conditions are properly logged with sufficient context for debugging
