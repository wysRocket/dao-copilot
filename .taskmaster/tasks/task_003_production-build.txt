# Task ID: 3
# Title: Production Build Creation and Optimization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create optimized production builds for multiple platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux) using Electron Forge, including bundle optimization, code splitting, asset optimization, dependency bundling, and platform-specific installers/distributables.
# Details:
This task involves creating optimized production builds for multiple target platforms:

1. Bundle Optimization:
   - Configure Vite build settings for production mode
   - Implement code splitting strategies to reduce initial load time
   - Enable tree shaking to eliminate unused code
   - Configure chunk size optimization for better loading performance
   - Implement dynamic imports for lazy-loading components

2. Asset Optimization:
   - Set up image compression pipeline for static assets
   - Configure font subsetting to reduce font file sizes
   - Implement proper caching strategies for static assets
   - Optimize SVG assets through minification
   - Set up proper handling of media files (audio/video)

3. Dependency Bundling:
   - Analyze and optimize npm dependencies
   - Configure proper externals for Electron dependencies
   - Implement proper Node.js native module handling
   - Set up dependency tree analysis to identify and remove unused packages
   - Configure proper bundling of third-party libraries

4. Platform-Specific Builds:
   - Configure macOS build settings (app signing, notarization, DMG creation)
   - Set up Windows build pipeline (code signing, installer creation, NSIS configuration)
   - Configure Linux distribution packages (deb, rpm, AppImage)
   - Implement platform-specific optimizations and feature flags
   - Set up proper icon sets and application metadata for each platform

5. Build Automation:
   - Create build scripts for each target platform
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline integration for automated builds
   - Configure build caching for faster rebuilds
   - Set up proper versioning and release tagging
   - Implement build artifact storage and distribution

# Test Strategy:
1. Bundle Verification:
   - Analyze final bundle size using tools like source-map-explorer
   - Verify code splitting is working by examining network requests
   - Check that tree shaking has properly removed unused code
   - Validate that dynamic imports are functioning correctly
   - Measure and document bundle load times in production mode

2. Cross-Platform Testing:
   - Install and test application on macOS, verifying DMG installation
   - Test Windows installer and application startup
   - Verify Linux package installation on major distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora)
   - Document any platform-specific issues or differences
   - Test application performance metrics on each platform

3. Optimization Validation:
   - Compare production build size against development build
   - Measure application startup time on each platform
   - Verify memory usage in production mode
   - Test application performance under various load conditions
   - Document optimization improvements with metrics

4. Distribution Testing:
   - Verify auto-update functionality works correctly
   - Test installation process on clean systems
   - Validate uninstallation process on each platform
   - Check that application metadata and icons display correctly
   - Verify application permissions and security settings

5. CI/CD Integration:
   - Confirm automated builds complete successfully for each platform
   - Verify build artifacts are correctly generated and stored
   - Test deployment of builds to distribution channels
   - Validate version numbering and changelog generation
   - Document the complete build and release process
