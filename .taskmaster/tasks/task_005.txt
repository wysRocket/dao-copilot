# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Connection Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement robust connection handling, including reconnection logic, heartbeat mechanism, and session management.
# Details:
1. Enhance WebSocketClient with reconnection logic using exponential backoff.
2. Implement heartbeat mechanism sending ping messages every 30 seconds.
3. Use the 'backoff' npm package (version 2.x) for implementing exponential backoff.
4. Create a ConnectionManager class to handle overall connection state.
5. Implement session management using JWT for authentication.
6. Use the 'jsonwebtoken' npm package (version 9.x) for JWT handling.
7. Implement proper resource cleanup on disconnection.
8. Use TypeScript enums for connection states (e.g., CONNECTED, DISCONNECTED, RECONNECTING).
9. Implement event emitters for connection state changes.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test ConnectionManager class methods.
2. Test reconnection logic with simulated network failures.
3. Verify heartbeat mechanism functionality.
4. Test session management and authentication flow.
5. Integration test with mock server to simulate various connection scenarios.
