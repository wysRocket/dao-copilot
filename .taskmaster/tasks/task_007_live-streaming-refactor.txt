# Task ID: 7
# Title: Optimize Performance and Memory Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize performance by eliminating multiple stream buffers and implementing efficient real-time text rendering.
# Details:
## Problem Analysis
Current implementation has performance issues due to:
- Multiple TextStreamBuffer instances
- Inefficient re-rendering of transcript components
- Memory leaks from uncleared subscriptions
- Excessive event handling overhead

## Performance Optimization Areas

1. **Stream Buffer Consolidation**:
   - Eliminate duplicate TextStreamBuffer instances
   - Create single, optimized streaming buffer
   - Implement efficient text chunking algorithms
   - Add memory management for long sessions

2. **React Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement React.memo for expensive components
   - Use useMemo for computed values
   - Optimize useEffect dependencies
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large transcript lists

3. **Animation Performance**:
   - Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
   - Implement efficient text measurement and rendering
   - Add frame rate monitoring and throttling
   - Optimize CSS animations and transitions

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Implement proper cleanup for stream subscriptions
   - Add garbage collection for completed streams
   - Optimize state storage and retrieval
   - Monitor memory usage patterns

## Implementation Steps
1. **Performance Profiling**:
   - Use React DevTools Profiler to identify bottlenecks
   - Measure animation frame rates
   - Profile memory usage during long sessions
   - Benchmark current vs. optimized implementations

2. **Create Optimized Components**:
   - Create OptimizedStreamingRenderer component
   - Implement efficient text chunking algorithm
   - Add performance monitoring hooks
   - Create reusable optimization utilities

3. **Implement Caching Strategies**:
   - Cache rendered text chunks
   - Implement intelligent re-render prevention
   - Add memoization for expensive calculations
   - Create efficient update batching

## Files to Create/Modify
- Create `/src/components/OptimizedStreamingRenderer.tsx` - Performance-focused renderer
- Create `/src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitoring.ts` - Performance tracking
- Create `/src/utils/TextChunkingOptimizer.ts` - Efficient text processing
- `/src/services/TextStreamBuffer.ts` - Optimize existing buffer

## Performance Targets
- Animation frame rate: Consistent 60fps
- Memory usage: < 50MB for 1000+ transcripts
- First paint time: < 100ms for new transcriptions
- CPU usage: < 10% during active streaming

## Success Criteria
- Elimination of performance bottlenecks
- Smooth 60fps animations during streaming
- Efficient memory usage with proper cleanup
- Responsive UI during high-frequency updates
