# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Robust Error Handling and Circuit Breaker Pattern for WebSocket Transcription
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6, 11, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling and circuit breaker pattern for WebSocket transcription to prevent cascading failures, with call depth tracking, duplicate request detection, and emergency recovery mechanisms.
# Details:
1. Design and implement a CircuitBreaker class for WebSocket transcription:
   - Define states: CLOSED (normal operation), OPEN (failing, not allowing requests), HALF-OPEN (testing if system has recovered)
   - Implement state transition logic with configurable thresholds and timeouts
   - Add metrics collection for failure rates and response times
   - Implement automatic reset after 30 seconds of being in OPEN state
   - Add manual reset capability via console command resetCircuitBreakers()
   - Implement status checking via console command checkCircuitBreakerStatus()

2. Implement call depth tracking mechanism:
   - Add a callDepth counter to track the depth of nested function calls
   - Set a configurable maximum call depth threshold (e.g., 50)
   - Implement early termination logic when threshold is approached
   - Add logging for deep call stacks to identify potential issues before they cause failures
   - Ensure proper detection and blocking of stack overflow conditions

3. Create duplicate request detection system:
   - Implement a request registry with unique identifiers for each transcription request
   - Add timestamp and metadata to track request frequency and patterns
   - Create logic to identify and handle duplicate or rapidly repeated requests
   - Implement cooldown periods for repeated identical requests

4. Develop emergency recovery mechanisms:
   - Create a StackOverflowDetector utility that monitors call patterns
   - Implement graceful degradation when stack issues are detected
   - Add memory usage monitoring to predict potential stack problems
   - Design a recovery protocol that can reset the transcription system without losing in-progress work
   - Implement emergency blocking with clear user feedback ("üö® EMERGENCY: Circuit breaker OPEN for transcribeAudio. Blocking call.")

5. Integrate with existing error handling:
   - Enhance the existing error handling from Task 3 (Circuit Breaker for Quota Exceeded)
   - Ensure compatibility with Task 6's retry logic and exponential backoff
   - Leverage the monitoring from Task 5 for better error detection
   - Coordinate with the memory-efficient processing from Task 12
   - Implement console commands for diagnostics and testing: runTranscriptionDiagnostics(), testCircuitBreakerReset(), runStackOverflowProtectionTest()

6. Add comprehensive telemetry:
   - Implement detailed error logging with context information
   - Create dashboards for monitoring circuit breaker status
   - Set up alerts for repeated failures or recovery events
   - Add tracing to visualize call patterns and identify problematic flows
   - Ensure clear success/failure logging with appropriate emoji indicators (‚úÖ, üö®, üõ°Ô∏è)

# Test Strategy:

   - Verify that call depth tracking prevents stack overflow under heavy load
   - Test recovery mechanisms under sustained high traffic
   - Measure performance impact of the new error handling mechanisms

## 7. Implement CircuitBreaker Class for WebSocket Transcription [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a CircuitBreaker class that manages the state of WebSocket transcription operations, preventing cascading failures by blocking requests during failure periods.
### Details:
Create a CircuitBreaker class with the following components:
1. State management (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF-OPEN) with appropriate transitions
2. Configurable threshold for failure count before opening the circuit
3. Timeout period for the OPEN state before transitioning to HALF-OPEN
4. Success threshold in HALF-OPEN state before closing the circuit
5. Metrics collection for failure rates and response times
6. Method to execute functions through the circuit breaker with proper error handling
7. Event emitters for state changes to enable monitoring

## 2. Implement Call Depth Tracking Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Enhance the existing call depth tracking in EmergencyCircuitBreaker with additional features and optimizations.
### Details:
1. Review and extend the existing call depth tracking in EmergencyCircuitBreaker.ts
2. Enhance the existing MAX_CALL_DEPTH (currently 50) with dynamic adjustment based on system performance
3. Add function name and argument tracking to the existing call depth mechanism
4. Implement more granular logging for different depth thresholds (warning at 70%, critical at 90%)
5. Create visualization tools for call stack depth patterns over time
6. Add performance metrics to measure impact of call depth on system resources
7. Implement call path analysis to identify common patterns leading to deep call stacks
8. Ensure proper detection and blocking of stack overflow conditions with clear error messages
<info added on 2025-07-29T12:50:26.686Z>
I've analyzed the current implementation of the EmergencyCircuitBreaker and identified the following enhancements needed:

- Current implementation uses a static MAX_CALL_DEPTH of 50 which doesn't adapt to system conditions
- Call history tracking is limited to 10 seconds with basic depth counting
- Rapid call detection threshold is set at >20 calls/second
- Function tracking lacks argument details and call path analysis

Implementation plan:
1. Create a SystemPerformanceMonitor class to collect CPU, memory, and response time metrics
2. Implement DynamicThresholdAdjuster that modifies MAX_CALL_DEPTH based on:
   - Current system load (reducing threshold during high load periods)
   - Historical call patterns (learning from past overflow incidents)
   - Available memory resources (scaling inversely with memory pressure)
3. Extend CallTracker class to store function signatures including argument types and values
4. Add tiered logging system with configurable thresholds:
   - INFO: >50% of MAX_CALL_DEPTH
   - WARNING: >70% of MAX_CALL_DEPTH
   - CRITICAL: >90% of MAX_CALL_DEPTH
5. Develop CallStackVisualizer utility for generating call tree diagrams
6. Implement CallPathAnalyzer to identify recurring problematic patterns

Will integrate with existing emergencyCallGuard() function while maintaining backward compatibility.

## 3. Develop Duplicate Request Detection System [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create a system to identify and manage duplicate or rapidly repeated transcription requests to prevent system overload and potential cascading failures.
### Details:

2. Generate unique identifiers for each request based on content hash and metadata
3. Store request timestamps and frequency information
4. Create detection logic for identifying duplicate requests within configurable time windows
5. Implement cooldown periods for repeated identical requests
6. Add throttling logic for clients sending too many similar requests
7. Integrate with EmergencyCircuitBreaker to enhance the existing rapid repeated calls detection (>20 calls in 1 second)
8. Implement cleanup mechanism to prevent memory leaks from stored request data
