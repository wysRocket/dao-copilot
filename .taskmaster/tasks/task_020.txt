2. Add session creation during connection establishment  
3. Add session suspension/resumption logic for disconnections/reconnections
4. Track session activity (messages, turns, connection events)
5. Implement session-based connection state recovery

NEXT STEPS:
- Add GeminiSessionManager as a dependency in the WebSocket client
- Initialize session manager in constructor
- Hook into connection lifecycle events to manage sessions
- Add session resumption logic to the reconnection process
