# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Glass Overlay Effects
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Create and apply glass overlay effects to enhance the overall UI aesthetics.
# Details:
1. Create a new GlassOverlay component using @rdev/liquid-glass-react
2. Implement subtle background patterns or gradients
3. Apply the overlay to the main application container
4. Ensure the overlay doesn't interfere with user interactions
5. Optimize the overlay for performance
6. Implement a toggle for enabling/disabling the overlay (optional)
7. Ensure the overlay is consistent across all windows in the Electron app

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the glass overlay renders correctly
2. Test that the overlay doesn't impact user interactions
3. Check performance impact of the overlay
4. Ensure the overlay is consistent across different screen sizes and resolutions
5. Validate that the overlay maintains its appearance across different operating systems
