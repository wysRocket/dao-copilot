# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Glass Overlay Effects
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Create and apply glass overlay effects to enhance the overall UI aesthetics.
# Details:
1. Create a new GlassOverlay component using @rdev/liquid-glass-react
2. Implement subtle background patterns or gradients
3. Apply the overlay to the main application container
4. Ensure the overlay doesn't interfere with user interactions
5. Optimize the overlay for performance
6. Implement a toggle for enabling/disabling the overlay (optional)
7. Ensure the overlay is consistent across all windows in the Electron app

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the glass overlay renders correctly
2. Test that the overlay doesn't impact user interactions
3. Check performance impact of the overlay
4. Ensure the overlay is consistent across different screen sizes and resolutions
5. Validate that the overlay maintains its appearance across different operating systems

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Base GlassOverlay Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a reusable GlassOverlay component using @rdev/liquid-glass-react that will serve as the foundation for all glass effects in the application.
### Details:
1. Install @rdev/liquid-glass-react package
2. Create a new component in src/components/ui/GlassOverlay.tsx
3. Implement configurable props for blur intensity, opacity, and border radius
4. Add support for custom background patterns/gradients as props
5. Ensure the component properly handles children elements
6. Create basic documentation for the component usage

## 2. Implement Background Effects and Patterns [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create subtle background patterns and gradient effects that will enhance the glass overlay aesthetics and provide visual depth.
### Details:
1. Design 3-5 subtle background patterns (dots, lines, or noise textures)
2. Create a gradient generator utility that produces dynamic gradients based on the application theme
3. Implement a BackgroundEffect component that can be composed with the GlassOverlay
4. Add animation options for subtle movement in the background patterns
5. Ensure all effects are optimized for performance

## 3. Create Depth Layers System for Visual Hierarchy [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a system of depth layers that uses the glass overlay with varying levels of transparency and blur to create visual hierarchy in the UI.
### Details:
1. Define 3-4 standard depth layers (foreground, mid-ground, background)
2. Create a DepthLayer component that extends GlassOverlay with preset configurations for each layer
3. Implement z-index management for proper stacking
4. Add subtle shadow effects to enhance depth perception
5. Create helper hooks or context for managing depth layers consistently across the application

## 4. Integrate Glass Effects with Existing UI and Add Toggle Control [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply the glass overlay components to the main application container and ensure proper integration with existing glassmorphism components. Implement a toggle control for enabling/disabling effects.
### Details:
1. Identify all application areas where glass effects should be applied
2. Refactor existing glassmorphism components to use the new GlassOverlay
3. Implement a global settings toggle for enabling/disabling glass effects
4. Add an effects intensity slider in the settings
5. Create a performance monitoring utility to ensure glass effects don't impact application responsiveness
6. Ensure consistent appearance across all windows in the Electron app
7. Add fallback styles for when glass effects are disabled

## 5. Debug Assistant Window Glass Effects [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Investigate and fix why glass effects are not appearing in the Assistant window
### Details:
1. Add debugging to AssistantWindowLayout to check glass config state
2. Increase opacity of background effects for better visibility
3. Add fallback gradient background when glass effects are enabled
4. Add visual indicator showing glass effects status
5. Test glass effects settings synchronization between windows
