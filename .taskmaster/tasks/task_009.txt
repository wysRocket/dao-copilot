# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Fallback Mechanism
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a fallback system to revert to the HTTP-based approach when WebSocket streaming fails.
# Details:
1. Create a FallbackService class to manage the transition between WebSocket and HTTP approaches.
2. Implement logic to detect WebSocket failures and trigger fallback.
3. Adapt existing HTTP-based transcription code to work alongside WebSocket implementation.
4. Use the Adapter pattern to create a common interface for both WebSocket and HTTP approaches.
5. Implement feature flags (use unleash-client-node version 3.x) to control fallback behavior.
6. Ensure seamless user experience during fallback transitions.
7. Implement logging and analytics to track fallback occurrences.
8. Use TypeScript discriminated unions for type-safe handling of different operation modes.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test FallbackService class methods.
2. Integration test fallback mechanism with simulated WebSocket failures.
3. Test seamless transition between WebSocket and HTTP modes.
4. Verify correct functionality in fallback mode.
5. User acceptance testing for uninterrupted experience during fallbacks.
