# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Error Detection, Classification, and Recovery
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive error handling system that detects, classifies, and recovers from various error conditions.
# Details:
Develop an ErrorHandler class that can detect and classify errors into categories (network, auth refresh, model quota, etc.). Implement specific recovery strategies for each error category. Add retroactive recovery for errors that previously aborted silently. Create an error telemetry system to track error rates and patterns. Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies to prevent cascading failures. Add user-facing error messages that provide appropriate information without exposing system details.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test error detection and classification with various error types. Test recovery strategies for each error category. Create integration tests that simulate different error conditions and verify recovery. Test circuit breaker behavior under sustained error conditions. Verify user-facing error messages are appropriate and helpful.
