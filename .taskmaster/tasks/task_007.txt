# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop UI Components for Real-time Feedback
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and update UI components to provide real-time feedback on transcription, connection status, and streaming progress.
# Details:
1. Create React components for real-time transcription display.
2. Implement a ConnectionStatusIndicator component.
3. Develop a StreamingProgressBar component.
4. Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) for state management.
5. Implement smooth animations using CSS transitions or react-spring (version 9.x).
6. Use styled-components (version 5.x) or Emotion (version 11.x) for component styling.
7. Implement virtualization (react-window library version 1.x) for efficient rendering of large transcription histories.
8. Use React.memo for performance optimization of functional components.
9. Implement keyboard accessibility and ARIA attributes for all new components.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test individual UI components.
2. Snapshot testing for component rendering.
3. Integration testing with mock data streams.
4. Accessibility testing using tools like jest-axe.
5. Performance testing for smooth animations and efficient updates.
