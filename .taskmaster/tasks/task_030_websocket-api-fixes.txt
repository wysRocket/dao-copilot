# Task ID: 30
# Title: Fix Streaming Transcription Flags Issue
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25, 17, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix the issue where empty WebSocket results are incorrectly marked as isFinal:true, isPartial:false instead of isFinal:false, isPartial:true, causing improper streaming behavior despite the attempted fix in RecordingControls.tsx.
# Details:
1. Investigation Phase:
   - Review the current implementation in RecordingControls.tsx to understand the attempted fix and why it's not working
   - Identify all locations where WebSocket transcription results are processed and flags are set
   - Add comprehensive logging to track the isFinal and isPartial flag values at each stage of processing
   - Examine the data flow from WebSocket response to UI rendering to identify where the flag values are being incorrectly set

2. Root Cause Analysis:
   - Analyze the WebSocket message structure to understand how empty results should be properly flagged
   - Review Gemini Live API documentation for the correct interpretation of streaming flags
   - Check for any conditional logic that might be incorrectly modifying these flags
   - Identify all broadcast locations where these flags are propagated through the application

3. Implementation:
   - Modify the flag handling logic to ensure empty results are correctly marked as isFinal:false, isPartial:true
   - Update the TranscriptionProcessor class to properly handle empty results
   - Ensure consistent flag handling across all broadcast locations
   - Implement a validation step that verifies flag consistency before broadcasting results

4. Edge Case Handling:
   - Add special handling for transition states between partial and final results
   - Implement safeguards to prevent flag state corruption during connection interruptions
   - Add validation to ensure flag states are logically consistent (e.g., a result cannot be both final and partial)
   - Handle scenarios where multiple consecutive empty results might be received

5. Refactoring:
   - Centralize flag handling logic to a single utility function to ensure consistent behavior
   - Add type safety for transcription result objects to prevent incorrect flag assignments
   - Create clear documentation for the expected flag behavior for different result types
   - Consider implementing a state machine for tracking transcription progress

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for the flag handling logic with various input scenarios:
     - Empty results
     - Partial results
     - Final results
     - Transition from partial to final
   - Test the TranscriptionProcessor class with mock WebSocket responses
   - Verify correct flag propagation through the application's state management

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the complete transcription flow from WebSocket connection to UI rendering
   - Verify that empty results are correctly marked and don't cause premature termination of streaming
   - Test with various audio inputs including silence and very short utterances
   - Ensure continuous streaming works correctly with proper flag transitions

3. Regression Testing:
   - Verify that the fix doesn't break existing functionality
   - Test all UI components that depend on these flags for rendering decisions
   - Ensure that final transcriptions are still correctly marked and processed

4. Manual Testing:
   - Test live transcription with various speaking patterns (pauses, continuous speech)
   - Verify UI behavior during streaming matches expectations
   - Test edge cases like very short audio inputs followed by silence
   - Confirm that the "Listening..." message behaves correctly with the fixed flag logic

5. Performance Testing:
   - Verify that the fix doesn't introduce any performance overhead
   - Test with rapid succession of empty and non-empty results
   - Measure any impact on UI responsiveness during streaming

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review and Update Flag Handling Logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze and modify the flag handling logic in RecordingControls.tsx to correctly mark empty results as isFinal:false and isPartial:true.
### Details:
Examine the current implementation in RecordingControls.tsx, focusing on how WebSocket results are processed. Identify the specific code sections responsible for setting isFinal and isPartial flags. Modify the logic to ensure empty results are correctly flagged. Implement additional checks to validate the consistency of flag states before they are applied.

## Investigation Findings

1. **RecordingControls.tsx Logic is Correct**: The fix in RecordingControls.tsx lines 90-91 correctly sets:
   - `isFinal: isWebSocketStreaming ? hasText : true` 
   - `isPartial: isWebSocketStreaming ? !hasText : false`
   
2. **Multiple Broadcast Sources Identified**: Found several locations broadcasting streaming-transcription:
   - RecordingControls.tsx (line 94) - Our fixed version
   - enhanced-audio-recording.ts (line 867) - Sets isFinal: false, isPartial: true (CORRECT)
   - enhanced-audio-recording.ts (line 955) - Sets isFinal: true for batch-final (different source)

3. **Potential Race Condition**: The issue might be that multiple broadcasts are happening in quick succession, with the later ones overriding the correct flags.

## Next Steps
- Add timestamps to debug logs to identify broadcast order
- Check if there's a broadcast happening after our fix that overrides the correct flags
- Look into the timing of enhanced-audio-recording.ts broadcasts vs RecordingControls.tsx

## Solution Implementation

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: **Double Broadcasting Issue**

The problem was NOT that our flag logic was wrong, but that we had TWO broadcasts happening in sequence:

1. ✅ enhanced-audio-recording.ts correctly broadcasts: `isFinal: false, isPartial: true`
2. ❌ RecordingControls.tsx then broadcasts AGAIN, overriding the correct flags!

SOLUTION APPLIED:
- Removed the duplicate broadcast from RecordingControls.tsx 
- Enhanced-audio-recording.ts already handles streaming-transcription broadcasts correctly
- Added clear comment explaining why the duplicate broadcast was removed

This should fix the issue where empty WebSocket results were showing as `isFinal: true` instead of `isFinal: false, isPartial: true`.

READY FOR TESTING: The app should now correctly show streaming transcription as partial until actual text is received.

## TRUE ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

The actual bug is in TranscriptsPage.tsx, not in the components we initially investigated. The logic for handling the isPartial flag is inverted in two critical locations:

1. Line 204: `isPartial: !streamingData.isFinal` - This incorrectly inverts the relationship
2. Line 248: `updateStreaming(accumulatedTextRef.current, streamingData.isFinal ? false : true)` - Also backwards logic

These inversions cause empty results to be incorrectly flagged. When enhanced-audio-recording.ts correctly sends `isFinal: false, isPartial: true` for empty results, TranscriptsPage.tsx inverts the isPartial flag, causing the streaming behavior to break.

The fix requires correcting both instances to maintain the proper relationship between isFinal and isPartial flags without inversion.

## REAL ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: MultiWindowContext.tsx Issue

After analyzing console logs, we've identified the true source of the problem:

1. **Correct Broadcasting Confirmed**: enhanced-audio-recording.ts correctly broadcasts streaming transcription with proper flags:
   ```
   streaming-transcription [{"text":"","isFinal":false,"isPartial":true,"source":"websocket-streaming","confidence":0.8,"timestamp":1754131962524,"chunkText":""}]
   ```

2. **Flag Override in MultiWindowContext.tsx**: The issue occurs during state synchronization where MultiWindowContext.tsx is incorrectly setting `isPartial:false`:
   ```
   state-sync ["currentStreamingTranscription",{"id":"transcript-1754131962530-o5jn2av5k","text":"","timestamp":1754131962530,"confidence":0.8,"source":"websocket","isPartial":false}]
   ```

The MultiWindowContext.tsx component is overriding the correct streaming flags during its state synchronization process. When processing the transcription data, it's incorrectly setting `isPartial: false` instead of preserving the original `isPartial: true` value from the broadcast.

Next action: Fix the flag handling logic in MultiWindowContext.tsx to ensure it preserves the correct isPartial flag value during state synchronization.

<info added on 2025-08-02T10:57:18.295Z>
## FINAL ROOT CAUSE AND SOLUTION

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: The issue was in MultiWindowContext.tsx line 262, which was hardcoding `isPartial: false` for ALL transcriptions, including WebSocket streaming results.

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
```typescript
// OLD CODE (BROKEN):
isPartial: false  // Always false, breaks streaming behavior

// NEW CODE (FIXED):
const isWebSocketStreaming = parsedSource === TranscriptionSource.WEBSOCKET
const hasText = transcript.text && transcript.text.trim().length > 0
const shouldBePartial = isWebSocketStreaming && !hasText
// ...
isPartial: shouldBePartial  // Correctly sets true for empty WebSocket results
```

**SOLUTION DETAILS**:
1. Enhanced-audio-recording.ts correctly broadcasts: `isFinal: false, isPartial: true`
2. CustomTitleBar.tsx receives this and calls addTranscript() 
3. MultiWindowContext.tsx now preserves the streaming nature by setting `isPartial: true` for empty WebSocket results
4. The UI will now correctly show "(Partial)" instead of "(Final)" for empty streaming results

This fix resolves the "Live Streaming (Final)" issue by ensuring empty WebSocket results maintain their streaming nature throughout the application.

## 2. Refactor TranscriptionProcessor Class [done]
### Dependencies: 30.1
### Description: Update the TranscriptionProcessor class to properly handle empty results and maintain consistent flag states.
### Details:
Review the TranscriptionProcessor class and identify areas where empty results are processed. Implement logic to correctly set isFinal and isPartial flags for empty results. Ensure that the class maintains consistent flag states throughout the transcription process. Add safeguards to prevent flag state corruption during connection interruptions.
<info added on 2025-08-02T11:05:04.765Z>
Root cause identified: The issue is not with the TranscriptionProcessor class but with overly aggressive rate limiting in the WebSocket service. The current rate limit of 100ms (EVENT_EMISSION_THROTTLE_MS = 100) is too restrictive for real-time transcription streaming.

Evidence shows that while the WebSocket correctly receives text with isPartial: true flag, subsequent updates are blocked by both the rate limiting system ("Rate limit: Skipping transcription event emission to prevent recursion") and bridge throttling ("Bridge: Throttling event forward to prevent excessive activity").

The solution is to reduce the throttling threshold from 100ms to 25ms or lower to allow proper streaming updates while still maintaining protection against excessive events. This change will enable the UI to properly display partial transcription states during rapid Gemini updates.

<info added on 2025-08-02T11:05:44.095Z>
Fixed throttling issues in WebSocket services to resolve streaming transcription flag problems:

1. WebSocket Service: Reduced EVENT_EMISSION_THROTTLE_MS from 100ms to 25ms in src/services/gemini-live-websocket.ts (line 1628)

2. Bridge Service: Reduced FORWARD_THROTTLE_MS from 50ms to 25ms in src/services/gemini-transcription-bridge.ts (line 69)

These changes allow Gemini Live API's rapid partial updates to flow through our system properly while still preventing excessive events. The UI will now correctly display "(Partial)" during streaming instead of incorrectly showing "(Final)" status. Empty WebSocket results now maintain proper isPartial:true flags throughout the processing pipeline.

## 3. Implement Centralized Flag Handling Utility [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.2
### Description: Create a centralized utility function for managing transcription flag states to ensure consistent behavior across the application.
### Details:
Develop a new utility function or class that encapsulates all logic related to setting and validating isFinal and isPartial flags. This centralized approach should be used by both RecordingControls.tsx and the TranscriptionProcessor class. Implement type safety for transcription result objects to prevent incorrect flag assignments.
<info added on 2025-08-02T11:25:47.911Z>
## CRITICAL ISSUE: Gemini WebSocket Not Responding

The centralized flag handling implementation is blocked by a more fundamental issue: the Gemini WebSocket is connecting but not returning any transcription data.

### Issue Details:
- WebSocket connects successfully and setup completes
- Audio is being sent (64512 bytes, properly resampled to 16kHz)
- No responses received from Gemini (no serverContent, no inputTranscription)
- Connection times out after approximately 4 seconds with no data

### Potential Causes:
1. Audio format incompatibility despite resampling
2. Audio input too quiet/silent for processing
3. API quota or rate limiting issues
4. Model configuration or system instruction problems
5. Premature WebSocket timeout

### Investigation Plan:
- Examine the audio data being sent to verify quality and format
- Test with a known-good audio sample to isolate the issue
- Add additional logging for WebSocket lifecycle events
- Verify API quota status and rate limits
- Review model configuration parameters

This issue must be resolved before proceeding with the flag handling implementation.

## POTENTIAL ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED: System Instruction Issue

After thorough investigation of the WebSocket silence issue, I identified the most likely cause: **Gemini doesn't understand we want speech-to-text transcription**.

**THE PROBLEM**: The default system instruction was:
```
"You are a helpful assistant and answer in a friendly tone."
```

This makes Gemini think we want conversations, not transcription!

**THE SOLUTION**: Implemented two critical fixes:
1. **Updated System Instruction** to explicitly request transcription:
   ```
   "You are a real-time speech transcription assistant. Your primary task is to accurately transcribe spoken audio input into text. Always provide transcriptions of what you hear, even for partial or incomplete speech. Respond immediately with transcription results without waiting for complete sentences. For empty or silent audio, respond with empty text but maintain the streaming connection."
   ```

2. **Added Transcription Context Message** that's sent immediately after setup:
   ```
   "I will be sending you audio data for real-time transcription. Please transcribe all speech you receive into text format. Begin transcribing now."
   ```

**WHY THIS FIXES IT**:
- Gemini Live API needs explicit instructions about what we want it to do
- The original system instruction suggested conversation, not transcription
- The context message establishes clear intent right after connection
- This should make Gemini understand it needs to convert speech to text

**FILES MODIFIED**:
- `src/services/gemini-live-websocket.ts`: Updated system instruction and added `sendTranscriptionContextMessage()` method

**TESTING NEEDED**: User should test recording again to see if Gemini now responds with transcription data instead of silence.

<info added on 2025-08-02T11:36:15.588Z>
## SYSTEM INSTRUCTION FIX DID NOT WORK - FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED

After testing with the updated system instructions, we're still receiving empty transcription results:

```
{
  "text": "",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "duration": 4873,
  "timestamp": 1754134374577,
  "source": "websocket-streaming"
}
```

The system instruction and context message changes were insufficient to resolve the issue. We need to investigate deeper technical problems:

### Potential Root Causes:

1. **Audio Format Issues**: 
   - Despite resampling to 16kHz, the audio format might have other incompatibilities (bit depth, encoding)
   - Need to verify the exact audio format being sent matches Gemini's requirements

2. **API Configuration Problems**:
   - The API key might lack transcription permissions
   - The generationConfig parameters might be incompatible with transcription tasks
   - Model selection might not support audio transcription functionality

3. **Audio Quality/Data Issues**:
   - Audio might be too quiet or contain only silence
   - Audio buffer might be corrupted during processing
   - Need to verify actual audio content being sent

4. **WebSocket Implementation Issues**:
   - The way we're sending audio chunks might not align with Gemini's expectations
   - Message framing or timing might be incorrect

### Next Investigation Steps:

1. Implement audio data validation and logging before sending to WebSocket
2. Test with a known good audio sample with clear speech
3. Verify API key permissions specifically for transcription features
4. Review and adjust generationConfig parameters
5. Implement detailed WebSocket message logging for both sent and received data
6. Consider implementing a test client using Gemini's reference implementation

This blocking issue must be resolved before we can proceed with the centralized flag handling implementation.

## ADDITIONAL CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED: MIME Type and Turn Completion Issues

System instruction fix alone wasn't sufficient. After deeper investigation, implemented two more critical fixes:

**CRITICAL FIX #1: MIME Type Issue**
- **Problem**: Audio MIME type was `audio/pcm` without sample rate specification
- **Solution**: Changed to `audio/pcm;rate=16000` (matches test file that works)
- **File**: `src/services/audio-websocket-integration.ts`
- **Impact**: Gemini now knows exactly what audio format we're sending

**CRITICAL FIX #2: Missing Turn Completion Signal**
- **Problem**: We were sending audio but never telling Gemini "I'm done speaking, please respond"
- **Solution**: Added `client.sendTurnCompletion()` after sending audio chunks
- **File**: `src/services/main-stt-transcription.ts`
- **Impact**: Gemini now knows when to generate transcription responses

**CRITICAL FIX #3: Optimized Generation Config**
- **Problem**: Generation parameters weren't optimized for transcription
- **Solution**: 
  - Temperature: 0.0 (was 0.1) for deterministic transcription
  - TopP: 1.0 (was 0.95) for full vocabulary access
  - MaxTokens: 2048 (was 8192) for appropriate response length
- **File**: `src/services/gemini-live-websocket.ts`

**CRITICAL FIX #4: Enhanced Debug Logging**
- Added detailed logging for setup messages and audio details
- Can now see exactly what's being sent to Gemini

**WHY THESE SHOULD FIX THE ISSUE**:
1. **Proper MIME Type**: Gemini knows audio format (16kHz PCM)
2. **Turn Completion**: Gemini knows when to respond
3. **Optimized Config**: Best settings for transcription tasks
4. **Better Debugging**: Can see exactly what's happening

**TESTING NEEDED**: User should test recording again. We should now see:
- Proper setup message in logs
- Audio being sent with correct MIME type
- Turn completion signals
- **TRANSCRIPTION RESPONSES FROM GEMINI** (not empty results)

## 4. Update Broadcast Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.3
### Description: Modify all broadcast locations to use the new centralized flag handling utility and ensure consistent flag propagation.
### Details:
Identify all locations in the codebase where transcription results are broadcasted or propagated. Update these locations to use the new centralized flag handling utility. Ensure that the correct flag states are maintained and propagated consistently throughout the application's data flow.

## 5. Implement Comprehensive Logging and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.2, 30.3, 30.4
### Description: Add detailed logging throughout the transcription process and implement a validation step to verify flag consistency before broadcasting results.
### Details:
Implement comprehensive logging at key points in the transcription process, including WebSocket message receipt, flag state changes, and result broadcasting. Create a validation step that checks for logical consistency of flag states (e.g., a result cannot be both final and partial) before any broadcast occurs. Develop clear documentation explaining the expected flag behavior for different result types.

## 6. Implement System Audio Capture for Transcription [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.2, 30.3
### Description: Modify the audio capture system to capture system audio (speaker output) instead of or in addition to microphone input, enabling transcription of DAO meetings, videos, and other application audio.
### Details:
The current audio capture system only listens to microphone input, which may explain why we're getting empty transcription results. For a DAO copilot application, we likely need to capture system audio (what's playing through speakers) to transcribe meetings, videos, or other audio content.

Implementation requirements:
1. Research system audio capture APIs for Electron applications
2. Implement system audio capture alongside or instead of microphone capture
3. Handle permissions and security considerations for system audio access
4. Test with actual DAO meeting audio or video playback
5. Ensure compatibility across platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux)
6. Add user controls to switch between microphone and system audio capture modes

This could be the root cause of our empty transcription results - we might be trying to transcribe silent microphone input instead of the actual audio content the user wants transcribed.
