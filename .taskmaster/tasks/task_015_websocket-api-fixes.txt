# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Audio Chunk Queue Manager for Memory-Efficient Streaming
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a dedicated AudioChunkQueueManager to prevent memory leaks and stack overflow errors by implementing proper chunk queuing, throttling, and cleanup mechanisms for processing large audio streams.
# Details:
1. Design and implement an AudioChunkQueueManager class:
   - Create a bounded queue data structure with configurable maximum size
   - Implement thread-safe enqueue and dequeue operations
   - Add throttling mechanisms to prevent memory exhaustion
   - Implement proper cleanup of processed chunks

2. Implement chunk lifecycle management:
   - Add timestamps to track chunk age and processing time
   - Implement automatic garbage collection for processed or stale chunks
   - Create monitoring hooks to track queue size and memory usage
   - Add emergency flush mechanism for recovery from overload conditions

3. Integrate with existing WebSocket transcription system:
   - Modify the audio processing pipeline to use the queue manager
   - Replace direct chunk processing with queue-based approach
   - Implement non-recursive chunk processing using async/await patterns
   - Add backpressure mechanisms to slow down chunk production when queue fills

4. Implement memory optimization techniques:
   - Use typed arrays (Float32Array) instead of regular arrays for audio data
   - Implement buffer pooling to reduce garbage collection overhead
   - Add configurable chunk size optimization based on available memory
   - Implement progressive chunk disposal after processing

5. Add instrumentation and monitoring:
   - Track queue depth, processing time, and memory usage
   - Implement warning thresholds for potential issues
   - Add detailed logging for queue operations
   - Create performance metrics for optimization

6. Implement graceful degradation strategies:
   - Add quality reduction for high-load scenarios
   - Implement selective chunk dropping for emergency situations
   - Create recovery mechanisms after overload conditions
   - Design circuit breaker integration to prevent system-wide failures

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for the AudioChunkQueueManager class
   - Test all queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, peek, flush)
   - Verify thread safety with concurrent operations
   - Test boundary conditions (empty queue, full queue)
   - Verify memory cleanup and garbage collection
   - Test throttling and backpressure mechanisms

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test integration with WebSocket transcription system
   - Verify end-to-end audio processing with the queue manager
   - Test with various audio file sizes and streaming rates
   - Measure memory usage during extended streaming sessions
   - Verify no memory leaks occur during long-running operations

3. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark queue operations under high load
   - Test with simulated 6+ minute audio files (known to cause issues)
   - Measure CPU and memory usage during sustained operation
   - Compare performance metrics before and after implementation
   - Test on different hardware configurations

4. Stress Testing:
   - Simulate extreme conditions with rapid chunk generation
   - Test recovery from artificially induced memory pressure
   - Verify system stability during prolonged high-load scenarios
   - Test graceful degradation mechanisms under stress

5. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure all existing transcription functionality works correctly
   - Verify compatibility with different audio formats and sources
   - Test interaction with other system components
   - Ensure no new bugs are introduced in related functionality
