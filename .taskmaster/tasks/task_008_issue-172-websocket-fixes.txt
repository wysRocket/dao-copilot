# Task ID: 8
# Title: Conduct System-wide Testing and Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the entire system, update documentation, and prepare for deployment.
# Details:
1. Develop and execute a comprehensive test plan:
   - Unit tests for all updated components
   - Integration tests for WebSocket and batch services
   - End-to-end tests simulating real-world scenarios
   - Performance and stress tests
2. Update system documentation:
   - API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Update README and contribution guidelines
   - Create/update architectural diagrams
3. Prepare deployment strategy:
   - Create/update Dockerfile and docker-compose files
   - Prepare database migration scripts if necessary
   - Update CI/CD pipelines

Example test plan structure:

# Test Plan for WebSocket and Batch Transcription Improvements

## 1. Unit Tests
- [ ] GeminiWebSocket class
- [ ] WebSocketConnectionEstablisher class
- [ ] AudioStreamingPipeline class
- [ ] BatchTranscriptionService class
- [ ] TranscriptionOrchestrator class
- [ ] Configuration management

## 2. Integration Tests
- [ ] WebSocket connection with Gemini API
- [ ] Batch transcription with Gemini API
- [ ] Fallback service integration
- [ ] Configuration across all services

## 3. End-to-End Tests
- [ ] Complete audio transcription flow (WebSocket)
- [ ] Batch transcription process
- [ ] Error handling and fallback scenarios
- [ ] Multi-user concurrent transcription

## 4. Performance Tests
- [ ] WebSocket connection stability under load
- [ ] Batch transcription with large audio files
- [ ] System performance with multiple concurrent users
- [ ] Memory usage and leak detection

## 5. Security Tests
- [ ] API key management
- [ ] WebSocket connection security
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization

## 6. Compatibility Tests
- [ ] Browser compatibility for Web Audio API
- [ ] Node.js version compatibility
- [ ] Docker environment tests
```

Example Dockerfile update:
```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Execute the comprehensive test plan:
   - Use Jest for unit and integration tests
   - Use Cypress for end-to-end tests
   - Use k6 for performance testing
2. Conduct code reviews for all changes
3. Perform manual testing of critical paths
4. Run security scans (e.g., npm audit, OWASP ZAP)
5. Verify documentation accuracy and completeness
6. Conduct a pre-deployment checklist review
