# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Real-time Transcription Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Process incoming transcription results from the Gemini Live API and update the UI components for real-time display.
# Details:
1. Create a TranscriptionProcessor class to handle incoming WebSocket messages.
2. Parse JSON responses from Gemini Live API (refer to API documentation for exact format).
3. Implement partial result handling for incremental updates.
4. Use a state management solution like Redux (version 4.x) or MobX (version 6.x) for managing transcription state.
5. Create action creators and reducers for updating transcription state.
6. Optimize rendering performance using React's useMemo and useCallback hooks.
7. Implement debouncing (use lodash.debounce version 4.x) for UI updates to prevent excessive re-renders.
8. Use Web Workers for heavy processing if needed to keep UI responsive.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test TranscriptionProcessor methods.
2. Test state management logic with various input scenarios.
3. Performance test UI updates with large volumes of transcription data.
4. Integration test with mock Gemini Live API responses.
5. User acceptance testing for real-time display responsiveness.
