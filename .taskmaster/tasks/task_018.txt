   e. Use snapshot testing for UI components

3. End-to-End Test Verification:
   a. Create automated test scripts using Playwright or Cypress
   b. Record test scenarios covering key user journeys
   c. Implement visual regression testing for UI components

   e. Verify browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

4. Error Handling Verification:
   a. Create a test matrix covering all error scenarios
   b. Implement network condition simulation (throttling, disconnection)
   c. Verify appropriate error messages are displayed to users
   d. Test recovery from each error condition
   e. Validate no data loss occurs during recovery

5. Performance Verification:
   a. Establish baseline metrics from current implementation
   b. Create performance test suite with automated benchmarking
   c. Measure key metrics:
      - Time to first transcription result
      - End-to-end latency
      - CPU and memory usage
      - Battery consumption
   d. Compare results with previous implementation
   e. Document performance improvements or regressions
   f. Integrate performance tests into CI/CD pipeline

6. Test Documentation:
   a. Document all test cases in a test plan
   b. Create test reports showing coverage and results
   c. Document any known issues or limitations
   d. Provide recommendations for future improvements
