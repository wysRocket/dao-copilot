# Task ID: 2
# Title: Environment Configuration and Build Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure production environment variables, build settings, and deployment configuration for the Electron application with Vite integration.
# Details:
This task involves setting up the proper configuration for production builds:

1. Environment Variables Management:
   - Create standardized .env file templates (.env.example) with required variables
   - Implement secure environment variable handling for production vs development
   - Configure environment variable loading in Vite and Electron processes
   - Document all required environment variables and their purposes

2. Electron Forge Configuration:
   - Set up Electron Forge makers for different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Configure code signing for production builds
   - Optimize packager options for production
   - Set up proper app metadata (name, description, version, icons)

3. Vite Build Optimization:
   - Configure proper build targets and browser compatibility
   - Set up code splitting and chunk optimization
   - Enable proper minification and tree-shaking
   - Configure asset handling and optimization

4. Build Tools and Dependencies:
   - Ensure all build dependencies are properly declared in package.json
   - Set up proper scripts for production builds
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline build steps
   - Document the build process and requirements

5. Security Considerations:
   - Ensure no sensitive information is included in builds
   - Configure Content Security Policy for production
   - Set up proper permissions in the Electron app

# Test Strategy:
1. Environment Variables Testing:
   - Verify that the application loads correctly with production environment variables
   - Test application behavior when required environment variables are missing
   - Confirm environment variables are properly isolated between main and renderer processes

2. Build Verification:
   - Execute complete production build process on all target platforms
   - Verify build artifacts are generated correctly with proper signatures
   - Check build size and optimize if necessary
   - Ensure builds run correctly on clean systems without development dependencies

3. Configuration Validation:
   - Review all configuration files for correctness and security
   - Validate that sensitive information is not included in build artifacts
   - Test application startup with production configuration

4. Documentation Review:
   - Verify that all environment variables are properly documented
   - Ensure build process documentation is complete and accurate
   - Confirm deployment instructions are clear and comprehensive
