# Task ID: 25
# Title: Fix WebSocket Transcription Rendering Issue
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 24, 11, 5, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Investigate and resolve the issue where WebSocket connections are successful but transcription responses from Gemini Live API are not rendering. Focus on audio duration requirements, response message processing, and continuous streaming implementation.
# Details:
1. Audio Duration Analysis:
   - Review Gemini Live API documentation for minimum and maximum audio duration requirements.
   - Implement checks to ensure audio chunks meet these requirements before sending.
   - Add logging to track audio chunk durations and any rejected chunks.

2. Response Message Processing:
   - Implement detailed logging of incoming WebSocket messages.
   - Create a MessageParser class to handle different types of API responses (transcription, error, metadata).
   - Ensure proper error handling for malformed or unexpected message formats.
   - Implement a queue system for processing messages to handle high-frequency updates.

3. Continuous Streaming Implementation:
   - Review and optimize the current streaming logic in transcribeAudioViaWebSocket function.
   - Implement a buffer system to smooth out inconsistencies in audio chunk delivery.
   - Use the Web Audio API's AudioWorklet for more efficient audio processing and streaming.
   - Implement proper backpressure handling to prevent overwhelming the API or client.

4. Rendering Optimization:
   - Profile the rendering performance using Chrome DevTools.
   - Implement efficient DOM updates using React's virtual DOM and memoization techniques.
   - Consider using a windowing library like react-window for rendering large amounts of transcript text.
   - Implement progressive rendering to display partial results as they arrive.

5. WebSocket Connection Management:
   - Implement a heartbeat mechanism to keep the connection alive during periods of inactivity.
   - Add automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff for connection drops.
   - Implement proper connection closure on component unmount or user-initiated stops.

6. Error Handling and Reporting:
   - Create a comprehensive error classification system for WebSocket and API-related issues.
   - Implement detailed client-side logging with error context and stack traces.
   - Set up error reporting to a centralized system (e.g., Sentry) for monitoring and analysis.

7. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement WebWorkers for CPU-intensive tasks like audio processing to prevent UI blocking.
   - Use IndexedDB or WebStorage for caching partial results to improve perceived performance.
   - Optimize WebSocket message frequency and payload size to reduce network overhead.

8. Accessibility Considerations:
   - Ensure real-time captions are properly formatted for screen readers.
   - Implement keyboard navigation for transcript navigation and control.
   - Add ARIA attributes to improve the accessibility of dynamically updated content.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for the MessageParser class, covering all expected message types and edge cases.
   - Test audio chunk duration validation logic with various input scenarios.
   - Implement unit tests for the rendering components, focusing on performance with large datasets.

2. Integration Testing:
   - Set up integration tests using a mock WebSocket server to simulate various API responses and scenarios.
   - Test the full audio capture, streaming, and rendering pipeline with different audio inputs and durations.
   - Verify correct handling of connection drops, reconnections, and error scenarios.

3. Performance Testing:
   - Conduct load tests simulating concurrent users and long transcription sessions.
   - Profile memory usage and CPU performance during extended transcription sessions.
   - Test rendering performance with large transcripts (100k+ words) to ensure smooth scrolling and updates.

4. Browser Compatibility:
   - Test the implementation across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and versions.
   - Verify WebSocket and Web Audio API compatibility and fallback mechanisms.

5. Network Condition Testing:
   - Use browser dev tools to simulate various network conditions (3G, high latency, packet loss).
   - Verify graceful degradation and error handling under poor network conditions.

6. Accessibility Testing:
   - Use screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) to verify the accessibility of real-time captions.
   - Conduct keyboard navigation tests to ensure all functionality is accessible without a mouse.

7. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Simulate various error conditions (API errors, WebSocket failures, audio device issues) and verify proper logging and user feedback.
   - Test error reporting to the centralized system and verify the completeness of error context.

8. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct UAT with a focus group, including users with different levels of technical expertise and accessibility needs.
   - Gather feedback on the responsiveness, accuracy, and usability of the transcription feature.

9. Security Testing:
   - Perform penetration testing on the WebSocket connection to ensure it's not vulnerable to common attacks.
   - Verify proper handling of sensitive data (e.g., API keys, user audio) throughout the transcription process.

10. Regression Testing:
    - Ensure fixes don't introduce new issues in previously working functionality.
    - Run the full test suite after implementing changes to catch any unintended side effects.
