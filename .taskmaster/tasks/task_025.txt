## 1. Implement Connection and Basic Communication Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and execute tests for WebSocket connection establishment and basic text communication with the gemini-2.0-flash-live-001 model.

### Description: Create comprehensive tests for session management functionality and bidirectional communication capabilities.
### Details:
Implement tests that verify session creation, ID assignment, session resumption after disconnection, timeout handling, and state persistence. Test multiple concurrent sessions to ensure isolation. For bidirectional communication, verify real-time streaming of inputs, simultaneous sending/receiving of messages, proper message ordering, and handling of overlapping requests. Focus on the reliability of maintaining session state across various scenarios.

## 3. Implement Error Handling and Reconnection Tests [pending]

### Description: Create tests that validate the system's ability to handle errors gracefully and reconnect properly after failures.
### Details:
Develop test scenarios that simulate various error conditions including server errors, network failures, and invalid messages. Verify that the reconnection logic works correctly with exponential backoff. Test recovery after reconnection and validate that error messages are handled properly and provide useful feedback to users. Ensure that the system maintains data integrity during error recovery.

## 4. Develop Modality and Configuration Tests [pending]
