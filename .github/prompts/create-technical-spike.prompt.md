# Create Technical Spike Document

Create time-boxed technical spike documents for researching critical questions that must be answered before development can proceed. Each spike focuses on a specific technical decision with clear deliverables and timelines.

## Document Structure

Create individual files in `${input:FolderPath|docs/spikes}` directory. Name each file using the pattern: `[category]-[short-description]-spike.md` (e.g., `api-copilot-integration-spike.md`, `performance-realtime-audio-spike.md`).

```md

title: '${input:SpikeTitle}'
category: '${input:Category|Technical}'
status: 'ðŸ”´ Not Started'
priority: '${input:Priority|High}'
timebox: '${input:Timebox|1 week}'
created: [YYYY-MM-DD]
updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
owner: '${input:Owner}'
tags: ['technical-spike', '${input:Category|technical}', 'research']

## Categories for Technical Spikes

### API Integration

- Third-party API capabilities and limitations
- Integration patterns and authentication
- Rate limits and performance characteristics

### Architecture & Design

- System architecture decisions
- Design pattern applicability
- Component interaction models

### Performance & Scalability

- Performance requirements and constraints
- Scalability bottlenecks and solutions
- Resource utilization patterns

### Platform & Infrastructure

- Platform capabilities and limitations
- Infrastructure requirements
- Deployment and hosting considerations

### Security & Compliance

- Security requirements and implementations
- Compliance constraints
- Authentication and authorization approaches

### User Experience

- User interaction patterns
- Accessibility requirements
- Interface design decisions

## File Naming Conventions

Use descriptive, kebab-case names that indicate the category and specific unknown:

**API/Integration Examples:**

- `api-copilot-chat-integration-spike.md`
- `api-azure-speech-realtime-spike.md`
- `api-vscode-extension-capabilities-spike.md`

**Performance Examples:**

- `performance-audio-processing-latency-spike.md`
- `performance-extension-host-limitations-spike.md`
- `performance-webrtc-reliability-spike.md`

**Architecture Examples:**

- `architecture-voice-pipeline-design-spike.md`
- `architecture-state-management-spike.md`
- `architecture-error-handling-strategy-spike.md`

## Best Practices for AI Agents

1. **One Question Per Spike:** Each document focuses on a single technical decision or research question

2. **Time-Boxed Research:** Define specific time limits and deliverables for each spike

3. **Evidence-Based Decisions:** Require concrete evidence (tests, prototypes, documentation) before marking as complete

4. **Clear Recommendations:** Document specific recommendations and rationale for implementation

5. **Dependency Tracking:** Identify how spikes relate to each other and impact project decisions

6. **Outcome-Focused:** Every spike must result in an actionable decision or recommendation

## Research Strategy

### Phase 1: Information Gathering

1. **Search existing documentation** using search/fetch tools
2. **Analyze codebase** for existing patterns and constraints
3. **Research external resources** (APIs, libraries, examples)

### Phase 2: Validation & Testing

1. **Create focused prototypes** to test specific hypotheses
2. **Run targeted experiments** to validate assumptions
3. **Document test results** with supporting evidence

### Phase 3: Decision & Documentation

1. **Synthesize findings** into clear recommendations
2. **Document implementation guidance** for development team
3. **Create follow-up tasks** for implementation

## Tools Usage

- **search/searchResults:** Research existing solutions and documentation
- **fetch/githubRepo:** Analyze external APIs, libraries, and examples
- **codebase:** Understand existing system constraints and patterns
- **runTasks:** Execute prototypes and validation tests
- **editFiles:** Update research progress and findings
- **vscodeAPI:** Test VS Code extension capabilities and limitations

Focus on time-boxed research that resolves critical technical decisions and unblocks development progress.
